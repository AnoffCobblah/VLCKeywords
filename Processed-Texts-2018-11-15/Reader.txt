                    “’T            IS an incalculable animal the general Reader!” George Henry
                                   Lewes wrote to George Eliot’s publishing house about sales of
                    the early books of Middlemarch (1871–72), which he hoped would “in
                    time haul in the general public.”1 As literary critics we have a tendency
                    to define the term “reader” by separating potential readers into different

              epistemological categories. Lewes’s “general Reader” and “general pub-
              lic” refer to actual people who read books. In contrast to these “readers,”
              literary critics use “the reader” in an abstract sense to refer to the ideal or
              implied consciousness in the position of receiving the book. A book his-
              torian might study one particular, historical reader who left behind a
              record. Compartmentalized as these definitions are, they share a basic,
              but sometimes unacknowledged, premise that a reader is not the author.
              Thus it is striking to find in the correspondence between George Eliot
              and her biggest Victorian fan, Alexander Main, not only overlapping
              meanings of the term reader, but that both writer and reader seem to
              share a fantasy of collapsing this distinction between their positions.
                      In this brief essay I examine Main’s unpublished letters in order to
              highlight some tensions around the various ways we envision, reconstruct,
              and ultimately project what we refer to as Victorian readers. An eccentric
              young Scotsman, Main wrote Eliot a fan letter in August 1871 on the pre-
              mise of asking how to pronounce “Romola”; Eliot continued to respond
              for several years to his effusive letters (Eliot’s publisher, John Blackwood,
              called him “The Gusher”) in which she found, as she wrote to Main,
              “intense comfort . . . in the response which your mind has given to
              every ‘deliverance’ of mine.”2 That Eliot allowed him to collect sound
              bites from her novels and publish them as The Wise, Witty, and Tender
              Sayings of George Eliot (1873) has been seen as an unfortunate instance
              of Eliot’s willingness to be flattered. Based on Main’s own letters,
              Rebecca Mead alternatively suggests Eliot was touched by Main’s appre-
              ciation of the higher moral purpose of her art.3 Main’s letters to Eliot
              continually refer to “the spiritual nourishment in your fiction” and her
              writing as “full of the tender yet strong Spirit of Humanity.”4 As Lewes
              wrote to Blackwood, Main’s letters “have been a source of extreme grat-
              ification and sustainment to Mrs. Lewes . . . because of the real insight
              and appreciation of her meaning on points where most critics and admir-
              ers seem to have been dead.”5 An actual, historical reader, Main saw him-
              self as an implied, idealized figure present in Eliot’s mind. As he wrote
              to her, “I feel (as both you and your noble husband have made me
              feel) that I am in some sense—in some very real sense—present to
              your thought.”6
                      If one of the great themes of Eliot’s novels is the ordinary distance
              between any two conscious minds, and the lyricality of those rare, sympa-
              thetic moments when they converge, she held a similar view of authors
              and readers. “What one’s soul thirsts for,” Eliot wrote in a letter about
              the critical reception she sought for Middlemarch, “is the word which is

                    the reflection of one’s own aim and delight in writing—the word which
                    shows that what one meant has been perfectly seized, that the emotion
                    which stirred one in writing is repeated in the mind of the reader.”7
                    Unlike Dickens, for whom the bigger the audience was, the better,
                    Eliot believed few readers would “perfectly seize” her meaning.
                    “Careful, appreciative readers are a small minority,” she wrote in defense
                    of the relative unpopularity of Romola (1863).8 Lewes famously helped to
                    keep Eliot apart from critical readings of her novels—“in a mental green-
                    house,” Margaret Oliphant said—which seems to have fostered a near-
                    sightedness about the reception of her work.9 Eliot as an author
                    expressed a need for the same sympathy she scripted for her characters,
                    and her exchanges with Main read like a scene from of one of her novels
                    in which that sympathy is, for one climactic moment, embodied.
                    Referring to his own letters, he writes, “I beg you to accept them, always,
                    as the expression, however imperfect, of a sympathy with you and all your
                    thoughts and feelings, which knows no bounds.”10 She received them as
                    such: “The thought of your letters, with all the evidence they contain of
                    no smallest effort on my part at truthful expression being thrown away,
                    has been a sustainment to me quite next to that of my husband’s sympa-
                    thy.”11 Eliot’s correspondence with Main gives dimensionality to how she
                    imagined not just an ideal reader, but the act of reading as ideally inter-
                    personal and interdependent, two minds coming together temporarily
                    through sympathy.
                            But because Main was an actual, historical reader, he eventually
                    showed the same irksome tendency as Eliot’s other Victorian readers
                    to forecast the plot. Even after Eliot warned him about “that sort of con-
                    struction beforehand which makes everything that actually happens a dis-
                    appointment,” far into Middlemarch’s serial publication he continued to
                    describe to her, in detail, why Will Ladislaw and Dorothea Brooke should
                    part for life.12 He adds, somewhat apologetically and somewhat boldly,
                    “You must not be angry with me for having ventured to finish the
                    novel in my own way.”13 Acknowledging his prescribed status as the nov-
                    el’s recipient, Main commands Eliot not to chastise him for overstepping
                    it; he rationalizes to her that the very “interest this part compelled me to
                    take in Dodo & Will . . . would not give me rest till I had followed them, in
                    imagination, to the close.”14 In consequence, Main’s letters to Eliot ulti-
                    mately heighten, rather than collapse, the division between an ideal
                    reader “present to your thought” (as Main flatteringly thought himself
                    to be) and an actual person who reads novels. Exciting current work is
                    happening towards recovering the ever-elusive, subjective experiences

              Victorian authors like Eliot were already aware of how little such minds
              could be scripted or calculated, and of the vital, creative role that projec-

              rian, and critic—in constructing and reconstructing any relationship

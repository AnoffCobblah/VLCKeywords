                    missionary schools in New Zealand and Australia, an effort meant “to fur-
                    ther what I believe to be a very important interest of our country, viz.,
                    how can we civilize without destroying the natives of our colony?”1
                    Nightingale’s ameliorative humanitarian goal was to combat the “racial
                    pessimism” and “demographic fatalism” shared by many observers in set-
                    tler colonies, who predicted the inevitable extinction of indigenous
                    groups.2 Instead, Nightingale hoped that the concrete statistics she gath-
                    ered from colonial administrators and school managers would allow her
                    to identify the “causes of mortality” in order to develop educational and
                    public health policies fostering the survival of indigenous populations.
                    Nightingale believed that measures such as “ample space, free ventila-
                    tion, cheerfulness, half-time at least given to outdoor work or play” and
                    “day-by-day reference to the past habits and history of the people”
                    would promote indigenous schoolchildren’s health.3 Nightingale’s
                    career encompassed multiple areas of humanitarian concern and action,
                    including her celebrated leadership of nurses caring for sick and
                    wounded British soldiers during the Crimean War (1854–56), her subse-
                    quent investigation and activism to reform military medical provisions,
                    and her efforts beginning in the mid-1860s to establish medical care in
                    workhouse infirmaries on a par with hospital care.4 Nightingale’s human-
                    itarian work also contributed to one of the major fields of modern inter-
                    national humanitarian assistance: protection of civilians and impartial
                    medical treatment of soldiers in wars and other violent conflicts. The
                    other major fields of modern humanitarianism include: assistance to ref-
                    ugees and internally displaced persons; famine relief; rescue followed by
                    medical care and distribution of aid and in the aftermath of natural disas-
                    ters; and treatment of the sick and public health interventions to prevent
                    spread of disease during major epidemics.
                            Nightingale’s project of amelioration in the settler colonies can also
                    be described as an example of humanitarian government, a key concept
                    for current research on and critique of humanitarianism developed by
                    anthropologist Didier Fassin, drawing on Michel Foucault’s theory of gov-
                    ernmentality, that pinpoints “a language that inextricably links values
                    and affects, and serves both to define and to justify discourses and prac-
                    tices of the government of human beings.”5 Pointing out a central “par-
                    adox” of humanitarianism that “the politics of compassion is a politics of
                    inequality” as well as “a politics of solidarity” with the poor and vulnera-
                    ble, Fassin identifies a “tension . . . between a relation of domination and
                    a relation of assistance” as “constitutive of all humanitarian govern-
                    ment.”6 Humanitarian government as an analytical term also applies to

              the forms of order imposed by non-governmental agencies and interna-
              tional organizations such as the United Nations. Historians Alan Lester
              and Fae Dussart use Fassin’s approach to trace a shift in British human-
              itarian government in its settler colonies from a “Protectionist” ameliora-
              tive approach in the 1830s, designed to reduce and mitigate the
              damaging effects of settler violence against indigenous populations, to
              a proto-economic-development approach during the 1840s and 1850s
              meant “to guide those surviving individuals through this process of amal-
              gamation” within “a programme for indigenous peoples’ future wel-
              fare.”7 Ideologically, this shift also “offered emigrant and metropolitan
              Britons an empire founded on violent dispossession without culpability.”8
                      Nineteenth-century humanitarians were frequently motivated by
              Christian beliefs and missionary goals, and their projects also had strong
              philanthropic and voluntary dimensions. In response to witnessing the
              carnage and endeavoring to assist wounded and dying French and
              Austro-Hungarian troops after the Battle of Solferino in June 1859,
              Swiss businessman Henri Dunant, who cited Nightingale as an inspira-
              tion for his efforts, published a memoir of his experience in 1862, Un sou-
              venir de Solferino (A Memory of Solferino). Through its detailing of soldiers’
              gruesome suffering and the inadequacy of medical assistance, this widely
              read text drew the attention of European leaders to the need for interna-
              tional laws guaranteeing the organization and protection of a voluntary
              medical corps to treat the wounded in war. Dunant would help to orga-
              nize a conference in 1863 held in Geneva that produced the first Geneva
              Convention signed by European powers in August 1864, thus launching
              the development of international humanitarian law. The first Geneva
              conference also led to the founding in 1863 of one of the earliest
              international, non-governmental humanitarian aid organizations, the
              International Committee of the Red Cross. In his narrative, Dunant influ-
              entially defined humanitarian concern as “[t]he moral sense of the
              importance of human life.”9 Dunant’s definition remains relevant for
              humanitarian ethics, or reflection on the purposes, values, and princi-
              ples, as well as the paradoxes, compromises, and conflicts, that character-
              ize modern humanitarian practice.10
                      Historians of humanitarianism place its formative rise in the
              late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, particularly in relation
              to the appeals to humane moral sentiments of benevolence and sympa-
              thy and public mobilization strategies developed within the international
              movement to abolish slavery and the slave trade.11 Historian Thomas
              W. Laqueur locates the emergence of a recognizable humanitarian

                    narrative, such as Dunant’s, in the techniques for mobilizing moral sen-
                    timents apparent in the realistic novel, the autopsy, the clinical report,
                    and the social inquiry. Across these texts, the humanitarian narrative is
                    characterized both by its “reality effect” based in “its reliance on detail
                    as the sign of truth” and its activation of readers’ moral sentiments by
                    depicting “the pains and deaths of ordinary people in such a way as to
                    make apparent the causal chains that might connect the actions of its
                    readers with the suffering of its subjects,” thereby presenting “ameliora-
                    tive action” as “possible, effective, and therefore morally imperative.” The
                    humanitarian narrative has a further defining element in its focus “on
                    the personal body, not only as locus of pain but also as the common
                    bond between those who suffer and those who would help and as the
                    object of scientific discourse through which the causal links between
                    an evil, a victim, and a benefactor are forged.”12 This triangle of protag-
                    onists translates into the modern constellation of humanitarian crisis,
                    recipients of assistance, and humanitarian practitioners, with the addition
                    of aid donors and the influence of governments. For Victorian literature
                    scholars, Laqueur’s work could invite further investigation of Victorian
                    writers’ humanitarian concerns, including possible connections of the
                    readerly sympathy often elicited by realist novels both to the humanitarian
                    narrative and to projects of humanitarian governance in Britain and its
                    empire. By extension, humanitarian motives also served in school class-
                    rooms in the colonies to articulate the moral influence, and to mask the
                    “civilizing” rationales, of the English literature curriculum.
                            Although humanitarianism is most often understood as “a global
                    architecture of concern for distant strangers,” the careers of Victorian
                    humanitarians such as Nightingale indicate that their concerns and ini-
                    tiatives were often transnational and linked to domestic reform efforts.13
                    Historian Caroline Shaw has also shown how the extension of liberal
                    humanitarian relief to refugees became a point of British national pride
                    through which Victorians across the social spectrum joined in fundraising
                    campaigns to assist exiles from republican political revolutions on the con-
                    tinent, such as Italians Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi, and
                    Hungarian Lajos Kossuth, as well as multiple African American fugitives
                    escaping slavery in the United States by taking refuge in Canada.14
                            To study nineteenth-century humanitarianism, therefore, is neces-
                    sarily to engage in transnational and transimperial scholarship that
                    places developments in Britain in relation to European politics and
                    wars and within British imperial networks of writing and publishing, gov-

              practices, educational initiatives, and the negotiation of moral concerns
              and political imperatives. Lester and Dussart point out the importance
              of spatiality, or the “particular global geography” of humanitarianism,
              which produced spaces of interaction that “were the products of a tenta-
              tive and negotiated coming together of indigenous and colonial practices
              and geographies.”15 Another space that has become a pervasive recourse
              of modern humanitarian government, the refugee camp, can also be
              traced in part to British military uses of internment camps to control
              the Boer civilian population in the context of the Anglo-Boer War
              (1899–1902).16

              piecemeal nature of British humanitarian government and humanitari-
              ans’ voluntary reform projects—shaped alike by colonial encounters
              and indigenous peoples’ resistance and their individual struggles for
              agency—research on humanitarianism can also contribute to a vibrant
              trend among today’s scholars to situate Victorian studies in the frame
              of Britain’s global empire.17

              how the Victorians doubled down on an idealized vision of childhood
              innocence inherited from the Romantics.
                      Yet Wilde was not alone in turning a jaundiced eye on his culture’s
              habit of conceiving of children as the epitome of goodness and attractive-
              ness. Even at the very beginning of Victoria’s reign, a motley crew of
              comic writers, artists, and dramatists had already begun producing hilar-
              ious send-ups of popular artworks that sacralized and often eroticized
              children. Studying these forgotten parodies can help us to expand our
              archive of cultural artifacts that perpetuated the phenomenon
              Victorian commentators dubbed “babyolatry,” “child-worship,” and “the
              cult of the child.”2 It can also assist us in figuring out which of our critical
              hunches about this cult hold water.
                      Consider, for example, humorist Thomas Hood’s “A Parental Ode
              to My Son, Aged Three Years and Five Months” (1836).3 Hood’s title
              invites us to smirk at fond parents and poets who presume that the public
              cares to know the precise age of child subjects such as Hartley Coleridge,
              the “faery voyager” who floats through William Wordsworth’s “To H. C.,
              Six Years Old” (1807) as well as Coleridge Senior’s “Frost at Midnight”
              (1798).4 Whereas his predecessors sing the praises of blissful babes
              who embody peace and joy and evoke a similar serenity in others,
              Hood’s efforts to apostrophize his son in such terms are repeatedly
              interrupted and undermined by the child’s own actions:
                      Thou happy, happy elf!
                      (But stop,—first let me kiss away that tear)—
                      Thou tiny image of myself!
                      (My love, he’s poking peas into his ear!)
                      Thou merry, laughing sprite!
                      With spirits feather-light,
                      Untouch’d by sorrow, and unsoil’d by sin—
                      (Good heav’ns! the child is swallowing a pin!)5
               This “Ode” parodies the archaic language Wordsworth and company use,
              as well as the solipsism whereby they reify the child as a symbol of their
              past selves or present status as advocates of nature, imagination, and sen-
              sibility in an increasingly industrialized society. The latter tendency man-
              ifests itself strongly in “Frost at Midnight,” in which the quiescent baby is
              such an absent presence that the father-narrator describes himself as
              enjoying “that solitude, which suits / Abstruser musings” over the course
              of a remarkably “calm” and “silent” night.6

                            Hood, by contrast, reminds us that writing about and taking care of
                    children are often antithetical activities. His father-narrator’s efforts to
                    glorify a depersonalized “cherub” keep getting derailed by the necessity
                    of comforting, cleaning, and corralling little John, who snuffles, pukes,
                    grabs a knife off the family table, and so on.7 Moreover, “A Parental
                    Ode” first appeared alongside Hood’s hilarious “Serenade,” which antic-
                    ipates the recent bestseller Go the Fuck to Sleep (2011) by rhyming the
                    soothing refrain “Lullaby, oh, lullaby” with desperate lines like “The
                    brat will never shut an eye,” “Mary, you must come and try!” and “Two
                    such nights, and I shall die!”8 Confirming Judith Plotz’s point that
                    Romantic poets who celebrate the Child of Nature “practice a kind of
                    forcible repatriation . . . that wrests children away from the female
                    sphere” of home and family,9 Hood goes the other way in these
                    “Domestic Poems” by highlighting how motherly labor behind the scenes
                    enables the productivity of male artists.10 After the newly mobile John
                    invades his father’s territory—“Thou idol of thy parents—(Drat the
                    boy! / There goes my ink!)”—the frazzled father-narrator of Hood’s
                    “Ode” concludes he “cannot write” unless his cherished wife Jane whisks
                    the troublesome tot upstairs.11
                            Digging up forgotten parodies of child-centered art can sometimes
                    help scholars to resolve critical debates about the cult of the child. Recall,
                    for example, the recent kerfuffle in Victorian Studies over John Everett
                    Millais’s Cherry Ripe, which was painted in 1879 and reproduced by the
                    London newspaper the Graphic as part of their 1880 Christmas Annual.
                    After Laurel Bradley attributed the popularity of this image of a pretty
                    little girl to its evocation of “timeless purity,” Pamela Tamarkin Reis
                    objected that Bradley’s account ignores the “pronounced pedophilic
                    appeal” of this picture, whereupon Robert M. Polhemus accused Reis
                    of engaging in a form of presentism that “ascribe[s] to others what she
                    sees herself.”12
                            Yet Reis’s position gains credence when we discover how a contem-
                    porary cartoonist made fun of Cherry Ripe. On January 8, 1881, the jokers
                    at Punch presented the public with “a Graphic Companion Picture to
                    Mr. Millais’ charming Cherry Ripe”: Cherry Un-Ripe, which went unsigned
                    when it first appeared, but was later attributed to one Mr. T. G.
                    Stowers (see fig. 1).
                            Title, caption, and image work together here to subvert the coy erot-
                    icism of the source text. Victorian porn described men who were sexually
                    interested in children as having a taste for “unripe fruit.”13 So the
                    descriptor “graphic” in the caption might have been functioning as a

                    eyes into one who is about to lose her lunch: the come-hither gaze of
                    Millais’s little charmer has been replaced by a grimace of gastric distress,
                    even as the dark gloves that originally drew our attention to her crotch
                    now clutch her stomach.
                             Like Hood, Stowers reminds us that children have minds (and
                    desires) of their own. Whereas Millais likens his little girl to fruit—
                    she’s a sweet, tempting morsel offered up for adult consumption—
                    Stowers has his little girl consume the fruit. The fact that the cherries
                    make her ill implies that being erotically objectified by adults like
                    Millais is not conducive to the health and happiness of children. But
                    young people, the cartoon’s caption hints, need not passively accept
                    such treatment. Instead, like the schoolchild whom the caption credits
                    for drafting Cherry Un-Ripe during his Christmas break, they can pick
                    up a pen and represent themselves in order to counter romanticized
                    adult depictions of children.
                             Was Stowers really underage? Probably not.14 But one thing’s for
                    sure: the Victorians were not as green as they were cabbage-looking.
                    Scholars tend to underestimate how much pushback there was against
                    the middle-class ideology of childhood innocence during the nineteenth
                    century because we generally pay more attention to canonical novels and
                    poetry than to comic verse, cartoons, puppet shows, pantomimes, and
                    other art aimed at mass, mixed-age audiences. We can wise up by
                    close-reading more silly stuff.

                    ELLEN CROWELL
                         N 1891, Punch inaugurated “Queer Queries,” a faux-advice column
                    I     where imaginary readers aired grievances and sought solutions. In
                    April 1891, “Urgent”—a starving vicar in a stingy parish—seeks counsel
                    on whether to pawn his “lectern and ancient carved pulpit” for food,
                    while “Perplexed”—whose property boundary has been breached by an
                    invasive “aroma of questionable herrings and very pronounced had-
                    docks” from the fish shop next door—asks whether to demand full
                    meals as compensation.1 Alongside these “Queer Queries” sits a poem
                    entitled “Coming Dress,” which dismisses as mere “queer robes” the sar-
                    torial future advocated by feminist reformers: “[S]hall we welcome with
                    delight / queer robes that make a girl a fright? / Pooh-pooh! We’re sim-
                    ply imperturbable. / The Reign of Fashion’s undisturbable.”2 Vicars, aro-
                    mas, and clothing here share queer pride of place; queer is that which
                    disturbs or perturbs; even (or especially) if their rumblings can be easily
                    contained by the boundaries of conventional humor and fashion. In
                    other words, in 1891 “queer” was punchy.
                            It is, of course, punchy again—perhaps even punch drunk. A Gale
                    Primary Sources term search suggests that “queer” hit a popular high-
                    water mark in the mid-1890s—a height it did not reach again until the
                    early 1990s. The pivot year was 1898, after which “queer” fell off precip-
                    itously and—after a small resurgence in the 1920s—kept falling. The fate
                    of “Queer Queries” speaks to this pinch point: inaugurated in 1891, by
                    1898 Punch had discontinued the feature entirely. When “queer” did
                    return to fin-de-siècle popularity levels in 1991, it did so only to blow
                    right through and keep rising, up through our present moment.

                                                                                                                   QUEER            817
              “queer” we know today is ever-more capaciously protean, such that it has
              inspired anxiety over the term’s expansive applicability, and efforts to
              slow down if not reverse a dilution of its historically specific critical power.
                      There is a paradoxical grief here: that the loss, pain, and shame that
              fueled “queer” as a political and theoretical term in the 90s and early 2000s
              (“you can hear the hurt in it”3) is being diluted by ever-broadening
              conceptions of counter- or anti-normativity; that “queer” is running on
              other fuels. A 2015 special issue of differences entitled “Queer Theory
              Without Antinormativity”4 invited scholars to trouble axiomatic conceptions
              of queer (in the words of Vicky Kirby, “how this relatively recent field of inter-
              vention and innovation runs to script”5) by rethinking static and monolithic
              conceptions of the norm. And a 2016 New York Times essay asked, “When
              Everyone Can Be Queer, is Anyone?” observing that if the goal of queer activ-
              ism is to move us ever closer to “the warm illumination of a horizon imbued
              with potentiality”6 then this “widespread acceptance and even appropriation”
              of “queer” seems to be moving us “both closer to and further from” this goal.7
              As it was in the late 1890’s, “queer” is again a flashpoint term. But whereas the
              problem today is capaciousness—“queer” loses meaning when it can describe
              anything that “ruptures and thwarts the oppressive circumscriptions of a
              norm by way of experimental possibility”8—in the late 1890s the problem
              was reversed: “queer” crashed at the start of the twentieth century because
              it lost its protean suggestiveness. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the first
              use of “queer” as “homosexual” to an 1894 letter in which the Marquess of
              Queensberry—whose infamous libel of Oscar Wilde led to the artist’s precip-
              itous downfall—used the phrase “Snob Queer” to describe then
              Prime Minister, Lord Rosebery, whom he suspected was sordidly implicated
              in his eldest son’s recent and suspicious death. But the way Queensberry
              attaches “Snob” to “Queer” complicates both words. Archibald
              Primrose, the Fifth Earl of Rosebery, may have been attracted to men, but
              to Queensberry, the Prime Minister’s lesser status within the Scottish peerage,
              not to mention his Liberal politics and his Jewish wife, all combine to make
              him a “Snob Queer” (or “pretentious interloper”). Homophobia informs
              this slur, just as preference for traditional femininity animates Punch’s mock-
              ery of “queer robes.” But “queer” here joins class snobbery and anti-Semitism
              to cathect multiple prejudices. Solidification into homosexual slur happened
              slowly, and the multivalent slipperiness that increased the term’s popularity
              up to and including this late-Victorian cultural moment held on at least
              through the late 1920s. Before this definitional specificity took firm hold,
              the word was not yet stripped of its valences, catches, hidden springs—
              those aspects of “queer” we both embrace and are wary of today.

                            The publications of the Sette of Odd Volumes, a late-Victorian gen-
                    tleman’s club founded in 1878 by London bookseller Bernard Quaritch,
                    help capture the fun-house mirror relationship between these two pro-
                    tean moments in the career of “queer.” A supper club for bibliophiles,
                    the Odd Volumes playfully cast themselves as displaced (odd) volumes
                    who, when brought together for monthly dinners, reassembled as a “per-
                    fect sette.” Originally limited to a membership of 21,9 when the Sette
                    began vetting “Supplemental Volumes” in the early 1890s, oddity had
                    taken on greater significance. Admitted new Volumes were “odd” in
                    eccentrically collectible ways. Bibliophiles all, their areas of expertise—
                    including Chinese snuff boxes, Irish wines, and Scottish witchcraft; chro-
                    nometry, chiromancy, and cocaine; rhinology, massotherapy, and forg-
                    ery; tarot cards, the art of idleness, and the Loch Ness monster—
                    additionally distinguished them as attractively queer.
                            The Sette’s “Year-Boke” for 1893 pays homage to both the Volumes
                    themselves and their queer habits of curation:
                             Where O. V.’s banquet, what a splendid store
                             Outvies the claims of gastronomical science:—
                             Old books, mad rhymes, wild melodies, rare faïence,
                             Weird songs, queer prints, quaint customs, and strange lore.10
                     Here, the “splendid store” describes both individual members and their
                    odd collections; “queer” joins a range of adjectives that together stake out
                    a realm of sociability in which oddity is celebrated for the way it playfully
                    alters convention, an expansive alterity, as Peter Coviello might observe,
                    “that is additive, a multiplication of differences in the absence of a single,
                    stable standard of measure.”11 In 1898, the queer collecting practices of
                    the Sette and their odd guests were again immortalized in verse:
                             And next Judge Martineau expressed his pleasure
                             In making now the acquaintance of a SETTE
                             So perfect in their oddness. At his leisure
                             He had compiled another odder yet;
                             For the First Number he had made his treasure
                             Of every work published in parts, and let
                             Its fellows pine unbought—a queer collection
                             If the first warranted the rest’s rejection!12
                     Martineau’s collecting practices are deemed “odder” than those of the
                    Odd Volumes, for to assemble a “sette” compiled solely of first numbers
                    is to “queer” not only your own collection, but also those now rendered

              forever incomplete. This “queer” is an act of “queering”—deliberate, per-
              formative, anti-normative—and yet having nothing to do with sexual iden-
              tity or gender expression. Despite having often hosted the now-infamously
              queer Oscar Wilde, and despite having weathered their own queer scandal
              in 1893,13 the Odd Volumes retained “queer” in their lexicon as late as
              1898, when it still served as a marker for nebulous deviations.
                      By recapturing a moment before “queer” began to contract, we find
              something of our own. Sutured to no definite ideological or political
              position, “Queer” in the 1890s was nonetheless not not political, not
              not ideological. Then, sensations, collections, fashions were queer because
              they pushed against prevailing conceptions of the possible and acceptable.
              Although already harboring in its folds the denotative forces that would
              soon expel ambiguity, the term was still at play, marking entrances to layers
              of experience below, beyond, or to the side of convention. “Queer” gained
              popularity in a cultural moment that valued suggestiveness. When defini-
              tively tied to homosexuality, its popularity plummeted—not to rise again
              until reclaimed as a political and theoretical term now used to describe
              an ever-widening arena “including dust, dna, certain kinds of worms and
              maybe also time itself . . . ”14 This very capaciousness, however, threatens
              to drain “queer” of its specificity. Will it tighten up again? Or are
              other terms—wild,15 neutral,16 neuter17—shedding layers to be reborn?

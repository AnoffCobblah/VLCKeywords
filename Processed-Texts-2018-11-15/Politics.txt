                             • 24 March 1832: Edward Bulwer [Lytton] votes for the Reform

                                                                                                              PO LITICS             807
                      • 30 August 1841: The gentleman-radical Feargus O’Connor
                          emerges from his prison term, where he is met by a jubilant
                          crowd. He is dressed in a suit of fustian, a fabric “worn exclu-
                          sively by nineteenth-century workmen.”1
                      • 19 October 1847: Smith, Elder and Company publishes Jane
                          Eyre.
                      • 30 April 1895: Oscar Wilde defends “The Love that dare not
                          speak its name” in open court.2
                      I assume that most VLC readers would agree that all four of these
              events might be meaningfully characterized as “political.” I further
              assume that the majority of my readers would agree that their political
              significance cannot be determined simply by referring to their proximity
              to institutional politics. (One cannot presuppose, for example, that
              Bulwer’s vote for the Reform Bill is intrinsically the “most political” of
              these events, in either substance or significance, merely because it took
              place within Parliament.) I wholeheartedly share these assumptions.
              And that is why we are in such a muddle.
                      In the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807), G. W. F. Hegel famously dismissed
              Friedrich Schelling’s theory of the Absolute as “The night in which . . . all
              cows are black.”3 By explaining the entirety of phenomenal existence by
              referring to a single, underlying concept, Hegel maintains that Schelling suc-
              ceeded only in reducing the rich diversity of the material world into an undif-
              ferentiated homogeny. Hegel’s barb is equally—and uncomfortably—
              applicable to the way that we employ “politics” and its cognates in contempo-
              rary Victorian studies.4 By characterizing virtually everything we analyze as
              “political,” we are merely rendering the darkness more visible.
                      How did we arrive here? Briefly: the theoretical paradigms (Marxist,
              feminist, poststructuralist) and identarian social justice movements of the
              last half-century spurred us to develop a far more sophisticated and capa-
              cious understanding of the “political,” as well as a keen awareness of its ubiq-
              uity. (Indexically, there is no entry for “politics” in Raymond Williams’s
              Keywords; it is the taken-for-granted horizon of the entire project.5) These
              are invaluable critical—and, indeed, ethical—gains. But they came at a
              cost: they plunged us into the night in which all cows are black.
                      What is to be done? It would be a theoretical regression to reserve
              the term “politics” for institutional governance and statecraft. Our chal-
              lenge, rather, is to develop a methodological self-consciousness and the-
              oretical vocabulary commensurate with the more expansive conception
              of “politics” that we now possess.6

                            First, we need to find ways to talk with greater precision about the
                    different registers, or modalities, of politics. While it is apparent that
                    each of the events I listed at the outset of this essay is political, it is no
                    less apparent that they are not political in the same way. It would greatly
                    benefit us to have the theoretical resources to conceptualize such distinc-
                    tions—even though we will want to complicate and problematize them in
                    individual cases.
                            Second, and more difficult, we must develop critical concepts that
                    will enable us to theorize how these different political modalities are con-
                    nected to one another. If the events I listed above indeed represent four
                    different modalities of politics, how do we theorize their interrelations?
                            Several clarifications are in order. I am not proposing that we
                    engage in a neostructuralist exercise in typology for typology’s sake.
                    Nor is the goal to set ourselves up as arbiters who retrospectively decide
                    which Victorian phenomena were “truly” political—much less to rank
                    nineteenth-century texts and events according to their “real” political
                    efficacy. What I am advocating, rather, is greater self-consciousness and
                    methodological clarity about the different valences of politics, as well
                    as their interconnections.
                            We can make considerable progress simply by taking more responsibil-
                    ity, as scholars, for being explicit about how we are conceiving of “the polit-
                    ical” in our own work. But a reinvigorated theoretical vocabulary will surely
                    help. This vocabulary need not necessarily be new provided that we use
                    extant concepts imaginatively and robustly. Several from the
                    Hegelian-Marxist tradition, in particular, strike me as promising, although
                    undoubtedly other critical paradigms have their own resources to offer.
                            The first of these concepts is mediation (Vermittlung). Mediation is of
                    course a multi-faceted term, but one of its most important uses is for des-
                    ignating how events or actions that occur in one part of a totality exert an
                    indirect impact on other spheres of that same totality. In a social totality
                    comprised of many relatively autonomous levels, mediation names how
                    interventions on one level ripple outward, sending shock waves that
                    pass unnoticed through some domains while violently upsetting others.
                            The second is nonsychronism (Ungleichzeitigkeit). Ernst Bloch
                    employed this concept to describe the precapitalist contradictions that
                    survive, unresolved, into the current mode of production.7 If conceived
                    more expansively, this term can help us articulate the fact that different
                    modalities of the political unfold according to very different temporali-
                    ties, none of which need be construed as primary or normative. They
                    are all parts of the ongoing dynamic that Williams called (third term!)

                    Neurology
                    ANNE STILES
                    T       ALKING about neurology during the Victorian era is tricky, in part
                            because the word itself and the discipline it signifies were both in
                    a state of transition. Coined by Thomas Willis in his 1664 treatise
                    Cerebri Anatome, the term “neurology” was seldom used before the late
                    nineteenth century, first appearing in the Lancet in 1859 and in the
                    British Medical Journal in 1861.1 Neurology as an independent medical
                    specialty, meanwhile, was not firmly established in Britain until after
                    the First World War, as historian of science Stephen T. Casper explains.2
                    Therefore, despite the watershed neurological developments occurring
                    in Victorian Britain, such as physician David Ferrier’s groundbreaking
                    maps of the cerebral cortex and the life-saving brain surgeries they
                    made possible, it can be misleading to refer retroactively to a Victorian
                    figure as a “neurologist” or to discuss the field of neurology as if it resem-
                    bled the highly specialized medical discipline it has become today.3
                            Instead, the study of the brain and nervous system during the early to
                    mid-nineteenth century was the shared project of individuals in many
                    emergent fields—including psychologists, philosophers, physicians, gen-
                    tleman amateurs, and even literary critics, some of whom were deeply inter-
                    ested in the latest physiological research. In this generalist intellectual
                    climate, polymathic thinkers such as George Henry Lewes, E. S. Dallas,
                    and Alexander Bain created a strain of novel theory that used physiological
                    principles to explain the mental processes and affective experiences of
                    readers, as Nicholas Dames demonstrates in The Physiology of the Novel
                    (2007). These thinkers and others like them made similar observations
                    about poems, whose metrical patterns imitate bodily rhythms and nerve
                    impulses, as Jason Rudy writes in Electric Meters (2009).
                            As the nineteenth century progressed, the mental sciences became
                    the province of trained researchers and state-funded laboratories as
                    opposed to gentlemen scholars like Bain and Lewes. Scientific writing,
                    too, became more professionalized and less accessible to lay readers, hav-
                    ing its own academic jargon and incorporating quantitative analyses, clin-
                    ical research, and complex animal experiments. With the creation of
                    specialized journals like Mind (1876–present) and Brain (1878–present),
                    and the advent of professional societies like the Neurological Society of
                    London (founded in 1886), the intellectual flexibility possible at mid-
                    century gradually receded from view.4

                                                                                                        N E U RO LOGY               785
                      Tellingly, literary scholarship that engages with Victorian mental sci-
              ences has tended to focus on mid-Victorian authors such as George Eliot,
              Charlotte Brontë, Charles Dickens, and Wilkie Collins, who benefited
              from the disciplinary openness of their era, as well as later authors like
              Thomas Hardy who read widely in mid-century scientific literature.5
              Criticism that engages with the more complex neurological ideas from
              later in the century, such as cerebral localization and the neuron doc-
              trine, is still comparatively rare. Nonetheless, some scientifically trained
              literary authors—such as H. G. Wells, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert
              Louis Stevenson, and Bram Stoker—could and did incorporate aspects
              of late-Victorian neuroscience into their fiction, as Laura Otis, Elisha
              Cohn, and I have argued in our respective works.6
                      The development of neurology into a full-fledged medical specialty
              continued apace into the twentieth century, resulting in specialized hos-
              pital wards, research labs, increased funding, and professorships dedi-
              cated to neurology. The culmination of this growth can be seen,
              among other places, in the modern university, where disciplinary silos
              prevail and meaningful interaction between sciences and humanities is
              unusual. The mid-Victorian moment described above seems almost
              utopic by comparison, in that scientists, philosophers, physicians, and lit-
              erary scholars freely communicated across disciplinary boundaries
              (which were, at that time, relatively permeable and still unfixed).
                      The relatively new field of cognitive literary studies attempts to re-
              create this bygone atmosphere of boundless interdisciplinarity and rela-
              tive equality between the disciplines. This field, which dates from the
              Presidentially proclaimed “Decade of the Brain” (the 1990s), turns to
              twenty-first-century neurology, psychology, linguistics, computer science,
              philosophy of mind, and anthropology to shed light on imaginative liter-
              ature of past eras.7 One frequently stated goal of such work is to bring
              neuroscientists and literary scholars in productive communication with
              each other, whether that means merely reading each other’s works or
              actively collaborating.8 While these are laudable endeavors, such interdis-
              ciplinary exchanges are too often one-sided. Humanists invite medical
              experts to our colloquia and conferences, but do they reciprocate?
              And if so, on what terms? Frequently, literary scholars invited to events
              in medicine and the life sciences are expected to use our expertise to
              teach empathy to exhausted physicians—as if such a feeling could be
              taught, or would necessarily be useful a clinical setting.9
                      In their current forms, cognitive literary scholarship and its recent
              offshoot, cognitive literary historicism, seem unlikely to change this

                    depressing status quo, even if these fields enrich our understandings of
                    individual literary works and genres.10 This is because—the occasional
                    interdisciplinary collaboration notwithstanding—most cognitive literary
                    scholars are based in literature departments and, quite appropriately, use
                    the vocabulary and theoretical tools available within their field.11 Clear
                    communication with neuroscientists and lay readers would require a process
                    of translation in which we demystify our own disciplinary jargon and
                    theoretical tools in addition to incorporating methods from the sciences.
                    Neuroscientists themselves would also need greater incentives to meet us
                    halfway. Given the vast disparity in research funding and job opportunities
                    between our respective disciplines, neurologists may see little material ben-
                    efit to collaborating with literary scholars. As humanists, then, we bear the
                    burden of communicating what practical or existential value we might
                    offer to our better-paid colleagues across campus. This unenviable task
                    might start with a closer look at the mid-Victorian era, when far-reaching
                    interdisciplinary collaboration was a reality, not a utopian ideal.

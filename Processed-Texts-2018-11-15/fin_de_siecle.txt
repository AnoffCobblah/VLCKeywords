              Fin de Siècle
              MATTHEW POTOLSKY
              F     IN de Siècle is a messy term, applicable to such a wide range of phe-
                    nomena as to be nearly incoherent. And yet, it serves an important if
              underappreciated function in Victorian Studies, disrupting the hermeti-
              cally sealed bell jar that any period identified with the life of a monarch
              can become. Defined by a sense of crisis and opposition, fin de siècle
              names those things that were never quite assimilated into the
              high-Victorian moment; openly cosmopolitan, it places that moment in
              a global context it often resisted.
                      Fin de siècle was first used in Britain in 1890, having been borrowed,
              accent and all, from France, where it had an earlier popular debut as the
              title of an 1888 play. Most obviously, it is a period term, but like so many
              other such terms, it also stands in for a characteristic style, set of affects,
              and dominant literary or artistic forms. A. O. Lovejoy famously argued
              that the word “romanticism” really designates at least three distinct
              “thought-complexes,” each an “exceedingly unstable intellectual com-
              pound.”1 Fin de siècle, I would argue, in Lovejoy’s spirit, designates no
              less than four “compounds”: a program, a mood, and an intellectual
              milieu, as well as a period in cultural history. These compounds are all
              “unstable”: changing the composition of one changes the nature of the
              others.
                      Consider the many different period definitions in fin-de-siècle studies.
              In an influential essay from 1974, “Truth in Labelling: Pre-Raphaelitism,
              Aestheticism, Decadence, Fin de Siècle,” Ruth Z. Temple argues that the
              period designated by fin de siècle should properly be restricted “to the
              last decade of the century.”2 This restriction accords with many early schol-
              arly studies, notably Holbrook Jackson’s The Eighteen Nineties (1919).3 But
              contrary to W. B. Yeats’s sardonic claim that “in 1900 everybody got
              down off his stilts,” the term fin de siècle tends in practice to cover a longer

                    span.4 The journal English Literature in Transition, which has done much to
                    promote scholarly work in the field, takes in the period from 1880–1920;
                    Sally Ledger and Scott McCracken’s collection Cultural Politics at the Fin
                    de Siècle (1995) picks the dates 1880–1914; the chronology in the
                    Cambridge Companion to the Fin de Siècle (2007) runs from 1885 to the
                    death of Queen Victoria in 1901; and the recent collection The
                    Fin-de-Siècle World (2014) claims the period 1870–1914.5 Many treatments
                    of the fin de siècle end it with the immediate aftermath of Oscar
                    Wilde’s 1895 trials, acknowledging the centrality of Wilde to the moment.
                    Seen as a global phenomenon, the period extends later into the twentieth
                    century, reflecting the uneven spread of Occidental trends to America,
                    Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
                            There is a logic, however obscure, to each period designation. The
                    longest designation, roughly corresponding to a familiar period in
                    French literary history, understands fin de siècle as the name for a partic-
                    ular artistic and cultural program leading to modernism in the twentieth
                    century. In this use, the term gathers under a single umbrella the various
                    avant-garde movements in late-Victorian culture—decadence, aestheti-
                    cism, arts and crafts, and so forth—defined by their cosmopolitanism
                    and their challenge to reigning conventions in art and society. The chal-
                    lenge arguably begins in 1848 with the first meeting of the Pre-Raphaelite
                    Brotherhood, whose theoretically driven artworks set the tone for all of
                    the movements that followed, though this tone only congealed into a rec-
                    ognizable stance in the 1870s, with the publication of Dante Gabriel
                    Rossetti’s Poems (1870) and Walter Pater’s Studies in the History of the
                    Renaissance (1873). Given a body blow by Wilde’s trials, the program was
                    eventually supplanted by Modernism, the story goes, in the years after
                    World War I.
                            The confines of the period change again when we consider fin de
                    siècle as the name for a mood or for an intellectual milieu. In both
                    cases, its time frame shrinks while the conceptual boundaries expand.
                    As a mood, fin de siècle designates the palpable sense of anxiety and pes-
                    simism that succeeded the optimism of the high-Victorian moment—
                    what Max Nordau ominously calls the “Dusk of Nations.”6 This mood,
                    widely diagnosed during the last years of the century, brings together a
                    variety of contemporary feelings, from an intuition of imperial decline,
                    to discomfort at the increasingly evident contradictions of global capital-
                    ism, and the fears roused by the looming end of a century: a sense of clo-
                    sure and decay founded on the anthropomorphic analogy between an
                    era and a life. In this usage, the term is typically restricted to the

              1890s, and perhaps a few years before or after. Seen, by contrast, as a cul-
              tural and intellectual milieu, the term links the various literary trends of
              the age—the neo-Gothic of Dracula, the colonial narratives of She or
              Heart of Darkness, the pessimistic naturalism of Thomas Hardy’s Jude the
              Obscure, the New Woman experimentalism of George Edgerton’s
              Keynotes—with a swirl of coeval intellectual movements: socialism, femi-
              nism, anarchism, sexology, degeneration theory, Uranianism, cosmopol-
              itanism. This usage, which came to the fore in the 1990s, derives from
              Raymond Williams’s designation of the years 1880–1914, in Culture and
              Society, as an “interregnum,” marked by the decay of Victorian hegemony
              and the early stirrings of what would become post-War culture.7 Rather
              than describing a mood or an exclusive avant-garde program, the term
              here captures a moment of transition, a unique confluence of interna-
              tional styles, movements, and theories in a particularly charged historical
              context.
                      Lovejoy was convinced that no one could do serious academic work
              on Romanticism without nailing down what they were talking about, and
              it might be argued that all four “compounds,” particularly the last two,
              are the product of a certain confirmation bias. But period and stylistic
              terms are also heuristics, generative of new definitions, not simply the
              final results of conclusive analyses. Seen in this light, the messiness of
              the term fin de siècle is a boon rather than a bane.

                    STEPHEN ARATA
                    A        TRUISM: to understand a work of literature you must attend not just
                             to what it says but to how it is made. That is, you must attend to
                    form. A second truism: it can be difficult to persuade students of the
                    truth of that truism. I am not suggesting that students never respond
                    to a work’s formal features, only that such responses tend to be felt in
                    the blood and felt along the heart rather than brought fully into con-
                    sciousness for the purposes of reflection or analysis. And, they sometimes
                    tell me, that’s as it should be. Implicit in their resistance to formal anal-
                    ysis is the suspicion that it is at best tangential to and at worst destructive
                    of what is most valuable in any particular work of literature. This is the
                    case whether the work in question is a lyric poem or a three-decker
                    novel. Why master scansion if the point of reading poetry is to be
                    made to feel physically as if the top of your head were taken off? Why
                    scrutinize modes of narration or map out textual networks when your
                    research interests center on questions of class or gender or empire that
                    are treated thematically, and with great power, in the novels you’re study-
                    ing? Formal analysis can seem pedantic or hermetic (or both), a set of
                    technical exercises designed to numb aesthetic response or else to quar-
                    antine literature from the richness and complexity of lived experience.
                            Outside the classroom, formalist criticism flourishes. A renewed
                    attention to form has led to some extraordinary work over the past two
                    decades. Thanks to this work, the questions we ask about form are richer,
                    more various, and more supple than they once were. Those questions can
                    invigorate not just our scholarship but our pedagogy, not least by making
                    formal analysis seem less pedantic or hermetic (or both). Yet their very
                    richness and variety only deepen the pedagogic challenges. Literary
                    form is a protean concept, and students may now wonder where one

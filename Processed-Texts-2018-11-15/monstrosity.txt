                    JAMES ELI ADAMS
                    M         ONSTERS are always with us. Whatever obscure psychic needs and
                               anxieties monsters address, monstrosity more obviously helps to
                    define the manifold meanings we attach to the idea of the human: mon-

              or defy that norm. Thus in Shakespeare, as Chris Baldick points out, mon-
              strosity serves to designate moral aberrations, of which the most important
              is ingratitude.1 In science, meanwhile, monstrosity was long understood in
              morphological terms, in anomalies that instilled “radical fear,” in Georges
              Canguilhem’s phrase, because they capture the precariousness of mere
              biological continuity. The monster is “a living being whose value is to be
              a counter-point,” underscoring that “the vital counter-value” to life is
              “not death but monstrosity.”2 A muted version of that discomfort may ani-
              mate Henry James’s famous dismissal of nineteenth-century novels as
              “loose, baggy monsters,” in which amorphous structure betrayed an inco-
              herence at once formal and ethical. Ironically, however, as monstrosity
              became transparent to scientific thought (Canguilhem points out) mon-
              sters increasingly found refuge in the realm of imagination. This furtive
              life has drawn particular attention to monstrosity in the nineteenth-century
              novel, which in turn has given broader currency to the topic within literary
              and cultural reflection of the past half century.
                      In the nineteenth century, monsters invaded the precincts of the
              domestic novel. Monstrosity had been lurking there all along, to be
              sure, but it was reanimated by the energies of an emergent feminist liter-
              ary criticism. Most influentially, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar’s
              Madwoman in the Attic (1979) took up the mission that Virginia Woolf
              had announced for women writers, the need to kill the angel in the
              house, and found in the monster “the angel’s necessary opposite and
              double,” a potent, threatening vehicle for the suppressed rage lurking
              beneath the angel’s outward serenity. The title gives pride of place to
              Jane Eyre, where even the saintly Miss Temple “has repressed her own
              share of madness and rage. . . . There is a potential monster beneath
              her angelic exterior.”3 Monstrosity had long been associated with politi-
              cal rebellion, in images of the mob as a “many-headed monster,” an asso-
              ciation revivified in conservative iconography of the monstrous
              revolutionary crowd. The feminine rage that critics discovered in
              Victorian domestic fiction, however, seemed all the more potent as it
              erupted from what had seemed a still point of refuge from such threats.
              In this light, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein became an especially resonant
              emblem of a manifold monstrosity. Although feminist critics pointed to
              the woman author’s special investment in the trauma of a monstrous
              birth, Shelley’s monster gained renewed prominence as it embodied a
              range of anti-social energies.
                      In light of Frankenstein, monstrosity could be seen as a central presence
              not only in the work of women writers but in nineteenth-century fiction

                    generally. Thus George Levine, in The Realistic Imagination (1981), an argu-
                    ment about “the monstrous” mapped before the publication of Madwoman,
                    in effect generalized Gilbert and Gubar’s stance, finding in Frankenstein a
                    template of the constitutive tensions of novelistic realism. Levine observes
                    that “the monster becomes those sexual, revolutionary, deterministic, or psy-
                    chic energies that novelists and individual confront even as they try to avoid
                    them.”4 Understood in such agonistic terms, monstrosity could be readily
                    extended to cover a range of tensions within a literary text, elicited through
                    a variety of critical approaches, particularly those derived from poststructur-
                    alist models. Thus Peter Brooks, for example, contended that monstrosity in
                    Frankenstein resides “above all in the question of language”: the text is “an
                    indelible record of the monstrous, emblem of language’s lack of transcen-
                    dental reference.”5 Once the monster’s manifold alterity had been discov-
                    ered, Jane Eyre became arguably the single most suggestive touchstone for
                    emergent, widely-diverse modes of reading nineteenth-century fiction,
                    from Lacanian psychology to postcolonial analysis.
                            Of course this proliferation of meaning could seem unproductively
                    self-reflexive, as Shelley’s novel encouraged an ever-ingenious troping of
                    an arresting motif. (The ur-exhibit of such critical resourcefulness may
                    be the reception of Bram Stoker’s Dracula, where the monster has
                    shown an uncanny power to figure everything.) But monstrosity gained
                    a larger conceptual purchase by way of the work of Michel Foucault,
                    whose influence began to be widely registered in Anglo-American criti-
                    cism in the 1970s. “The sleep of reason produces monsters,” Goya
                    famously declared, but Foucault’s Madness and Civilization (Histoire de la
                    folie, 1961) argued that the monstrous was needed to produce normative
                    reason. The classical organization of madness, so powerfully attached to
                    the dissolvent force of “unreason,” turns madness into a form of mon-
                    strosity—and “monster,” Foucault reminds us, derives from montrer: mon-
                    sters are “beings or things to be shown,” here to enforce the claims of
                    reason.6 Monstrosity thus comes to point beyond any particular text or
                    literary tradition to become integral to dominant orders of discourse.
                            But while Foucault’s early work offered little prospect of escape
                    from those structures, for other critics monstrosity held a continuing
                    allure as the mark of a radical singularity or discursive rupture, which sug-
                    gested the potential for a liberatory politics. Thus Derrida, for example,
                    declared that “the monster is a species for which we do not yet have a
                    name”; hence “the future is necessarily monstrous,” because otherwise
                    “it would already be a predictable, calculable, and programmable tomor-
                    row.”7 This sense of unformed potentiality may align monstrosity with

              radical transformations of the present, as when Donna Haraway invokes the
              monster to preside over new visions of political and social possibility,
              “effects of connection, of embodiment, and of responsibility for an imag-
              ined elsewhere that we may yet learn to see and build here.”8 Here the mon-
              strous birth is no longer a nightmare, but a (shadowy) dream of a
              transfigured world. For other critics, however, such open-endedness
              renews the power of the monster as a vehicle of collective anxiety.
              Monstrosity in this light, declare the editors of Monster Culture in the
              Twenty-First Century, is “a necessary condition of our existence in the twenty-
              first century.”9 But that claim might hold for any century. As we conjure up
              monsters both to enforce norms and to resist them, it seems the only thing
              that could dispel monstrosity would be the death of normativity itself.

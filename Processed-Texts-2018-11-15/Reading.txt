              Victorian authors like Eliot were already aware of how little such minds
              could be scripted or calculated, and of the vital, creative role that projec-
              tion plays—ever on the part of all those involved, author, reader, histo-
              rian, and critic—in constructing and reconstructing any relationship
              between a reader and a text.

                    for the same reader, who might approach the same text with a variety of
                    different reading goals, fluctuating levels of motivation to pursue those
                    goals, and new domains of background knowledge, to say nothing of
                    the reader’s variable moods, preferences, and physical surroundings.
                    Psychological efforts to develop an architecture for reading do not dis-
                    count these individual differences but are pitched at a scale of analysis
                    that makes it possible to identify a set of processes that many reading
                    acts share. This more abstract model of reading can in turn assist literary
                    scholars with developing more sensitive accounts of how specific cultural
                    and material conditions might affect actual communities of readers.
                    Scholars can become attuned to how some of the conditions that contrib-
                    ute to the reading experience have transformed more rapidly than oth-
                    ers, and to the fact that not all of these transformations affect every
                    aspect of the reading process in exactly the same way. By imposing cer-
                    tain constraints on our assumptions about how reading works, cognitive
                    perspectives on the comprehension process make it possible to develop
                    more precise and powerful claims about the influence of specific cultural
                    and historical conditions. They can also help us move beyond longstand-
                    ing assumptions about what novels do.
                            For instance, even as critics of Victorian fiction have made powerful
                    claims about how nineteenth-century novels teach, train, interpellate,
                    conscript, and construct their readers, what exactly happens during the
                    reading process in many ways remains a mystery in literary studies.
                    While readers routinely reach for metaphors like being transported by
                    or lost in a book, critics have sometimes framed this phenomenon as a
                    process of narrative seduction. Georges Poulet goes so far as to assert
                    that, when reading, his consciousness is overtaken “by the thoughts of
                    another.”1 The sense of self-forgetfulness and surrender that can accom-
                    pany a reader’s absorption in fiction corresponds to psychologist Mihály
                    Csíkszentmihályi’s concept of “flow.” In the 1970s, Csíkszentmihályi
                    found that activities such as reading, painting, playing chess, sculpting,
                    composing music, and dancing could give rise to optimal experiences
                    of attentional absorption, in which participants reported becoming obliv-
                    ious to everything else, losing track of time and awareness of themselves.2
                    Such experiences are relatively rare because the activity being performed
                    must be complex enough to hold our attention without being so difficult
                    that it leads to frustration. It is only when a task is just right for our par-
                    ticular interests and abilities that we can become so absorbed in it that we
                    feel passively borne along by the flow of the activity itself. In other words,
                    as much as readers might feel as if they are gripped or riveted by a story,

              achieving flow is possible only when they feel in control of their actions
              and environment.
                      Because the felt experience of reading is so distinct from the mental
              acts underlying it, knowing more about the basic architecture of reading
              permits us to draw sharper distinctions between what novels can and can-
              not do to their readers. Contrary to the longstanding assumption that
              novel reading can be a passive or mindless activity, readers become
              absorbed in a book because the process of comprehending a text places
              significant demands on their finite cognitive resources. According to the
              prevailing model of text comprehension first proposed in 1983, readers
              comprehend fictional sentences in the same way that they comprehend
              nonfictional ones.3 To comprehend a sentence from Bleak House such
              as, “Mr. Guppy sat down at the table and began nervously sharpening
              the carving-knife on the carving-fork,”4 readers must construct a mental
              representation of what is described based on the verbal cues that Dickens
              provides. These cues prompt readers to retrieve their existing back-
              ground knowledge, such as what a table is or what it means to sharpen
              something, as part of making inferences about the action Guppy per-
              forms. Here I do not mean to suggest that readers pause to imagine
              for themselves all the details of the implied scene, but only that, as
              part of comprehending a text, readers necessarily come away with mental
              content that is more like the physical world than like the printed text.
                      Our discipline’s longstanding concern with how novels provide read-
              ers with the knowledge and abilities they lack has obscured the extent to
              which literary experience is entwined with what readers already know and
              are able to do. According to cognitive theories of the embodied mind,
              features of our empirical experiences become encoded in memory as
              multimodal “traces” of the original experiences themselves, and these
              experiential traces can subsequently be retrieved as part of new mental
              representations.5 This embodied view of the relationship between lan-
              guage, perception, and action reestablishes the importance of
              Ferdinand de Saussure’s assertion in 1916 that words cannot be sepa-
              rated from the concepts they bring to mind.6 If comprehending a narra-
              tive necessarily involves constructing a mental representation of what the
              text describes regardless of whether it really refers to objects that exist in
              the physical world, novelists bring their object “home to us in all its con-
              crete particularity” in part by selecting details that are literally close to
              home.7 Readers assist with the writer’s effort to evoke fictional persons
              and places by drawing upon their own rich store of background knowl-
              edge, which they have in turn acquired from their own everyday labor

                    of engaging with the physical world. In this regard, nineteenth-century
                    novels are not so much a training ground where readers practice forms
                    of perception that they will apply in everyday life. Rather, the knowledge
                    they have acquired and the capacities they have honed from the cumula-
                    tive labor of everyday experience make it possible for readers to grasp a

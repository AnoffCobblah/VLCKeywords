              JULIA F. SAVILLE
                     O many in the twenty-first century, “soul” is a residual concept—a
              T      remnant of metaphysical discourses gradually displaced in the nine-
              teenth century by the vocabulary of the new sciences of mind such as psy-
              chiatry, psychology, and neurology.1 Yet when poetry scholars Susan
              J. Wolfson and Herbert F. Tucker explored Romantic and Victorian gen-
              dering of soul nearly two decades ago, they opened up the concept and

                    its consequent discourse—“soul-talk”—to more wide-ranging investiga-
                    tion in terms of its ethico-political significance for poets.2
                            Most Victorian poets had a strong opinion about soul: Elizabeth Barrett
                    Browning, for instance, considered it the nonmaterial counterpart of the
                    fallen fleshly body, incompatible with material representation and only par-
                    tially accessible to consciousness. For Arthur Hugh Clough, soul had affinities
                    with today’s psyche, a rational consciousness dogged by irrational compul-
                    sions. But for literary scholars today, perhaps some of the most intriguing
                    insights on soul emerge from Jeremy Bentham’s Theory of Fictions where it
                    takes the form of a nonmaterial or “inferential entity” that cannot be affirmed
                    by perception but only “inferred from a chain of reasoning.”3 Like other
                    inferential entities—among them God and love—soul can only be under-
                    stood in relation to a real, perceivable entity, like the body.
                            Bentham designates inferential entities “fictitious,” by which he
                    means grammatically spoken of as if perceivable, even though the
                    claim of perceptibility is not actually being made: “To be spoken of at
                    all, every fictitious entity must be spoken of as if it were real.”4 To call
                    soul “fictitious” is not therefore to imply that it has no existence or is a
                    “non-entity,” but rather to indicate that its existence cannot be verified
                    by the sensory perceptions. The limitation of language imposes this
                    choice between “existence” and “non-existence,” so that in reality, ficti-
                    tious entities owe “their impossible, yet indispensable existence,” as
                    well as their shape, to language itself.5 Fictitious entities such as soul
                    are therefore linguistic inventions, multifarious language effects without
                    which we could not think, or discuss our thoughts, feelings, or intuitions
                    or their relations to material conditions.6 They are linked to both physi-
                    cal and mental experience without being reducible to either, so that
                    Bentham’s fictions, as Isobel Armstrong explains, offer a way of negotiat-
                    ing between language’s capacity both to detach from the things it
                    describes and to signify those things.7
                            As an enabling fiction, soul existed in as many forms as the bodies
                    used to represent it, but in his pioneering “animadversions” Tucker iden-
                    tifies two prevailing conceptions in the nineteenth century, both drawing
                    on classical models and each lending itself to particular Christian inflec-
                    tions. The pneuma (L. spiritus), a spirit imprisoned in the temporal,
                    fallen body, is prominent in Protestant doctrines. It is based on the
                    assumption that “soul and body do not mix” and is “the majority position
                    on the soul.”8 Pneuma is as resistant to imagination and material repre-
                    sentation as is the divine spirit from which it derives, and it therefore
                    requires “feats of representational prowess” to be accessible.9

                      An alternative model, psuche¯ (L. anima), is an embodied vitalizing
              principle that is as “hospitable to imagination as the pneuma is hostile.” It
              belongs with “immanence” and is commonly manifest in Roman Catholic
              incarnationist ideas such as Gerard Manley Hopkins’s Christ, who “plays
              in ten thousand places, / Lovely in limbs and lovely in eyes not his.”10
              Tucker’s point is not that this pairing is in any way stable; on the contrary,
              we may find individual poets exploiting both models for diverse effects.
              Rather, nineteenth-century soul-talk reminds us of the paradox underlying
              representation itself—namely, that to reach imaginatively beyond the mate-
              rial limits of this world is still to be bound by the materiality of language. It is
              the medium of our imaginative aspiration, whether we choose to protest its
              inadequacy to pneuma—the “filthy rags of speech” derided by Browning’s
              Pope11—or relish its capacity for creativity (psuche¯). The inferential nature
              of the soul allows us that choice.
                      Given nineteenth-century poets’ sensitivity to language’s representa-
              tive paradoxes, their virtuoso language skills, and the vigor with which
              they experimented with poetic form, soul was presumed to be their spe-
              cial bailiwick. John Stuart Mill, for one, confidently observes that “The
              truth of poetry is to paint the human soul truly: the truth of fiction is
              to give a true picture of life.”12 Furthermore, reform-minded poets,
              such as the Brownings, Clough, and Algernon Charles Swinburne under-
              took to remind readers that since the time of Plato and Aristotle, spiritual
              well-being had been considered crucial to a healthy polis. Soul was
              indeed integral to the concept of “civic virtue,” recognizable today as
              an underexamined dimension of virtue’s successor, “moral character,”
              and the “character-talk” to which it gave rise.13 For soul’s inferential
              nature allowed poets to negotiate between the empirical, referential
              experience of political praxis and the abstract idealism of ethics to pro-
              duce an ethico-political discourse that resisted yielding to either.

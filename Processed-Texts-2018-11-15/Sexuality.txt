                    T       HE common view that modern sexuality was invented through sci-
                            ence, and especially by sexologists and social scientists such as
                    Edward Carpenter, Havelock Ellis, and Richard von Krafft-Ebing, has
                    encouraged an understanding of sexuality and desire through classifica-
                    tory frameworks and models of measurable ab/normalcy. While Steven
                    Marcus made famous the view that Victorians hid their bounty of sexual-
                    ity under bustles of decorum and denial, Michel Foucault proposed no
                    less than a macrostructural system tapping into the power of sexuality
                    through institutionalizing discourses.1 While offering crucial insights,
                    these formulations have also tended to encourage a devaluing of the

              amorphous spirit of attractions and affections that we today appreciate, as
              did many Victorians, for invigorating our senses and moving our bodies.
              As Vernon Lee complained in 1905 about driving past a landscape rather
              than feeling the soles of her feet scrambling in it, the former lacks “the
              tangible joy, working deep into our nerves, of the massive real . . . the
              mark of complete possession working deep into the soul, which belongs
              to desires that struggle for their accomplishment.”2 Desires, as Lee sug-
              gests, surface in the most surprising places and through quite unex-
              pected modes of contact.
                      Prior to the Victorians, there is no record of the term “sexuality”
              being used to refer to an awareness of having such sensual desires, and
              it was not until the twentieth century that the notion of sexual identity
              became a familiar concept in western society. Thus, when we today
              speak of a shift of the primary understanding of sexuality from the het-
              eronormative, individuated standpoint to the ungrounded experience
              of the fluid, queer, postqueer, and posthuman, we champion a vocabu-
              lary and collective imagination more sympathetic to the phantom-like
              desires that Victorians themselves experienced and engaged.
                      “Sexuality” refers to one’s own urges for other sentient beings, other
              things, and one’s self, as well as to one’s eroticism as it is projected by and
              appeals to others. These drives are both general and specific, uncon-
              scious and conscious, human and otherwise. As nineteenth-century
              authors repeatedly demonstrate, sexuality operates as a shared, mediated
              resource, some participants taking a greater stake in it than others.
              Victorians were particularly aware of the ways in which such multi-
              directional and often uncontrollable forces—with their astounding
              moral and cultural potency—might at any moment as easily undermine
              as reinforce institutionalized systems of analysis and control. Literary rep-
              resentations of sexuality often served as moral edicts aimed at harnessing
              and channeling passions toward a middle-class directive, but just as likely
              (and even simultaneously) they articulated anxieties around the inevita-
              ble escape of energy, the leakage of desire. The eponymous subject of
              Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” (1842) is murdered because she
              “liked whate’er / She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.”3 In
              Mary Elizabeth Braddon’s short story “Eveline’s Visitant” (1862), the her-
              oine withers away because her desires are obsessively drawn toward “a
              phantasm of [her] romantic brain,” a haunting ideal disinvested from
              the power and control of the established order.4 The servant in
              Algernon Swinburne’s poem “The Leper” (1866) is scorned by the
              afflicted heroine herself because his devotion affirms the social ostracism

                    that she can never imagine accepting.5 In Vernon Lee’s “Oke of
                    Okehurst, or The Phantom Lover” (1890), meanwhile, Alice Oke is
                    shot dead by a husband driven mad by the trans-historicity of her affec-
                    tions.6 In Victorian literature, sexuality is repeatedly rendered, enjoyed,
                    and squelched precisely because it does not simply rest within the indi-
                    vidual, but pulses forcefully through diverse channels of relationality.
                            As these examples make apparent, sexuality does not rely on the
                    human. Its drives and pulls can operate with little awareness of the sen-
                    tience of the subjects and objects engaged in the networks that give
                    shape to being and self-understanding. Oscar Wilde’s 1885 poem “The
                    Harlot’s House” offers a succinct rendering of not only the common ten-
                    dency to try to homogenize and direct the powers of sexuality into norma-
                    tive discourses, but also sexuality’s inability to stay within such prescribed
                    channels. To date, the work has primarily been read as a critique of lust
                    and female prostitution (prostitution itself personified as female) against
                    the backdrop of a male narrator’s purer love of his female beloved. But
                    there are certain curious ambiguities in Wilde’s poem—the fact that
                    Love herself is drawn to enter the brothel of lust, or that a “puppet” is gen-
                    dered female in one stanza, while a “marionette” is referred to as “it” in the
                    next.7 The characters are all highly stylized and most are indeed puppets of
                    desire in the tradition extending from E.T.A. Hoffmann’s “The Sandman”
                    (1816), with its seductive automaton Olympia, to Rachilde’s Monsieur Venus
                    (1884), published a year before “The Harlot’s House.” Wilde’s subjects
                    come across primarily as mechanical dolls who do not possess their sexual-
                    ity but have it cast upon them like shadows upon a screen.
                            And yet this relatively brief poem also goes out of its way to problem-
                    atize a crisply constructionist reading of sexuality. Love enters into lust.
                    Pleasure is orgiastic rather than individuated. The characters embody
                    the sound of musical instruments that run through the piece, themselves
                    becoming waves of aural pleasure. They are also lost elements of nature
                    such as “black leaves wheeling in the wind.” While elsewhere, they are
                    “shadows,” “ghosts,” and “phantom lover[s].”8 Various, multidirectional,
                    evanescent—the characters are not individuals but, rather, whirling
                    exchanges of passions and sensations. “The Harlot’s House” operates prin-
                    cipally as a series of urges, compulsions, and attractions driven by move-
                    ment and sensuality. Perhaps not so remarkably, then, the sincerest
                    emotion in this imaging of sexuality is that of the environment that
                    comes to encompass the scene. The poem ends not with Love, not with
                    the self-distancing narrator, not with a singular character at all—but with
                    the anthropomorphized rising dawn who, “with silver-sandalled feet, /

                     O many in the twenty-first century, “soul” is a residual concept—a
              T      remnant of metaphysical discourses gradually displaced in the nine-
              teenth century by the vocabulary of the new sciences of mind such as psy-
              chiatry, psychology, and neurology.1 Yet when poetry scholars Susan

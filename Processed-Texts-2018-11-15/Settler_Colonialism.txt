                    MELISSA FREE
                    B       RITISH settler colonies, colonies of occupation, and plantation
                             colonies were built on unequal relationships between colonizer and
                    colonized, and entailed the correlative exploitation of distant land,
                    labor, and other resources.1 While distinguishing between them is useful,
                    the terms themselves are Eurocentric constructs, even as they denote mate-
                    rial realities; the lines between them are not hard and fast; and no two col-
                    onies were exactly alike. British residents of colonies of occupation (like
                    India and Hong Kong) were temporary and largely male. These mer-
                    chants, missionaries, soldiers, and administrators (who, particularly in
                    the latter two cases, sometimes moved between colonies) formed a “thin
                    white line” of control over indigenous populations.2 British residents of
                    planation colonies (like those in the Caribbean) were only somewhat
                    more permanent. These mostly upper-class plantation owners often spent
                    months or even years in Britain, where their wives and children, if they
                    had them, were as likely as not to reside. Because the Caribbean’s indigenous
                    population had been all but destroyed through contact with earlier
                    European settlers, the British generated a labor force by importing
                    Africans as slaves and Indians as indentured servants. Though non-whites
                    outnumbered whites significantly, resistance—to poor working conditions,
                    slavery (pre-1833), and other forms of inequality—was met with brutal repri-
                    sal. As in colonies of occupation, resources flowed out.
                            Settler colonies (in the nineteenth century, primarily Canada,
                    Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa) were distinct from colonies
                    of occupation and plantation colonies in that large numbers of British
                    men, women, and children emigrated to them with the intent to remain
                    permanently. These several million Britons (more than 1.5 million

              during Queen Victoria’s reign alone) of varied classes and occupations
              sought to build futures in their new homes not only for themselves,
              but for their descendants, as well.3 Like those (primarily) sojourning
              Britons in other types of colonies, they facilitated colonial Anglicization
              through the dissemination of British values and customs, but they also
              reproduced those values across generations (who long continued to
              see themselves as British, even as they developed hybrid identities).
              And while resources were extracted to Britain, they also accrued to
              settlers.
                      Settler colonies were a site of “constant negotiation.”4 While colonial
              discourse framed settler lands as empty—there for the taking—colonists,
              administrators, and soldiers seized it from its indigenous (and in some
              instances also European-descended) denizens, displacing them through
              a variety of means.5 As Patrick Wolfe explained in a 2012 interview:
              “Settler-colonialism is a form of colonialism that is exclusive. It’s a ‘win-
              ner take all,’ a zero-sum game, whereby outsiders come to a country,
              and seek to take it away from the people who already live there, remove
              them, replace them, and displace them, . . . and make it their own.”6
              Tracey Banivanua Mar and Penelope Edmonds elaborate: “policies of
              assimilation, merging, absorption, [and] protection”—from intermar-
              riage to the forced removal of children from their families—“heralded
              a range of legally sanctioned practices whose goal of abolishing
              Indigenous peoples’ languages, histories and identities are increasingly
              identified as genocidal.”7 Indigenous groups responded to British settlers
              and policies with multiple forms of resistance, negotiation, and, in some
              instances, (largely coerced) cooperation.8 Not only were indigenous-
              colonial relations fundamental to settler identity, they were, as Annie
              E. Coombes has argued, “the historical factor which . . . ultimately shaped
              the cultural and political character of the new nations.”9 From this van-
              tage point, apartheid South Africa was not an exception; it was the end
              of a spectrum.
                      The terminology used to describe settler colonialism has shifted over
              time. “What is now called settler colonialism was known in the nineteenth
              century as ‘colonization’” and settler colonies were simply called colo-
              nies.10 Today’s umbrella term, imperialism, “the practice, the theory,
              and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant
              territory,” was known as colonialism.11 Though even today colonialism
              is sometimes used in this older, broader sense, it more often denotes,
              in the words of Edward Said, “the implanting of settlements on a distant
              territory”—in short, settler colonialism.12 Said himself had surprisingly

                    little to say about settler colonialism, a term that emerged in Australia in
                    the 1920s, “to distinguish it from convict colonialism.”13 The index of
                    Orientalism—which of course is primarily about the Middle (or Near)
                    East—contains no entries for settler colonialism, settler, colonialism,
                    Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, emigration, or immigra-
                    tion.14 And while colonialism occupies twenty-eight pages in Culture
                    and Imperialism, settler, settler colonialism, emigration, immigration,
                    and New Zealand still make no appearance; the entry for Australia lists
                    twenty-one pages, Canada, six, and South Africa, five. When Said did dis-
                    cuss settler colonialism, he tended to fold it into the broader discourse of
                    imperialism, as would most postcolonial scholars who followed in his
                    immediate wake. Other scholars read settler colonial histories and litera-
                    tures as part of national narratives.
                            Only in the last two decades has settler colonialism emerged as its
                    own field, one that engages settler colonial histories and literatures
                    beyond (though not apart from) national contexts and views them as dis-
                    tinct from (though not without shared characteristics of) broader impe-
                    rial discourse. Important early texts include Daiva Stasiulis and Nira
                    Yuval-Davis’s edited collection, Unsettling Settler Societies: Articulations of
                    Gender, Race, Ethnicity and Class and Patrick Wolfe’s Settler Colonialism
                    and the Transformation of Anthropology: The Politics and Poetics of an
                    Ethnographic Event, in which he argues that “invasion is a structure not
                    an event.”15 There have been several excellent monographs and collec-
                    tions on settler colonialism in the last few years, mostly by historians.
                    The most influential by far is James Belich’s Replenishing the Earth: The
                    Settler Revolution and the Rise of the Anglo-World. Notable recent work in
                    other disciplines includes John Darwin’s The Empire Project, an economic
                    study; analyses of settler narratives by Jude Piesse, Tamara Wagner, and
                    the contributors to Victorian Settler Narratives (which Wagner edited);
                    and Fiona Bateman and Lionel Pilkington’s multidisciplinary collection,

                            The Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History, an online journal begun in
                    1999, published a special issue on settler colonialism in 2003. Edited by Fiona
                    Paisley, it “set out to contribute to . . . intracolonial scholarship on white set-
                    tler colonialisms and the colonial turn,” which “coalesce[s] around an aware-

              Studies, an online journal edited by Edward Cavanagh and Lorenzo

                      Since 1998 several collections have been published based on the
              idea of “the British World,” “a framework . . . concerned with exploring
              the networks and flows of people, goods and ideas that connected these
              various settler colonial spaces and places.”19 In common with the new
              imperial history—which is more theoretically informed, interdisciplinary,
              and postcolonial in its approach—British World historiography suggests
              that “the seeds of transnationalism” are rooted in imperialism.20 But

                    British World historiography, until very recently, has tended to give this
                    definitional aspect short shrift.
                             Given the waves of white nationalism that have so recently and pub-
                    lically resurfaced in erstwhile metropoles and colonies alike, attention to
                    the violence, erasure, and genocide that were part and parcel of settler
                    colonialism is as urgent as ever. Much remains to be done in the still
                    growing field of settler colonialism. In particular, there is room for
                    more extensive study of South Africa; literary analyses that consider
                    both colony and metropole; and comparative analyses, both between
                    British settler colonies and between British and other settler colonies.

                            million Britons emigrated from Britain between 1837 and 1901, of
                            which approximately one-third went to Australia, New Zealand,

                    Uchronia
                    AARON WORTH
                    I    N 1857, the French philosopher Charles Renouvier imagined that the
                          Roman Empire had never become Christian, in a work titled Uchronie,
                    a term Renouvier invented to designate “[une] utopie des temps
                    passés”—a utopia of past time.1 While his tale (as this phrase suggests)
                    was set in the historical past, literary scholars today tend to employ
                    “uchronia” in a more expansive sense, as an umbrella category compris-
                    ing alternate history stories, parallel worlds stories, and tales involving
                    “future uchronias”; as Amy Ransom notes, “Just as the ou-topos, the
                    no-where of utopia, may be either good (eutopian) or bad (dystopian),
                    so may the ou-chronos rewrite the past, explore the future or lie parallel
                    to the reader’s present.”2 In our own time, of course, uchronian narra-
                    tives have never been more popular—at the time of this writing, two of
                    the most-discussed television programs on air are adaptations of Philip
                    K. Dick’s The Man in the High Castle and Margaret Atwood’s The
                    Handmaid’s Tale—while the tendency to think of reality in terms of a
                    branching of multiple “forking paths” (in Borges’s phrase) has entered
                    into our cognitive habitus. Until recently, the emergence of uchronian
                    themes in fiction has been largely discussed in connection with the

              early twentieth century, in particular with the American “scientifiction”
              pulps of the 1930s and 1940s (Murray Leinster’s “Sideways in Time,” pub-
              lished in 1934 in Astounding Stories, is an often-cited milestone). The same
              period is often associated with the appearance of counterfactual histori-
              ography: Sir J. C. Squire’s pioneering anthology “If It Had Happened
              Otherwise,” for instance, appeared in 1931.
                      Far less attention, by contrast, has been given to what might be
              called the prehistory of these uchronias, in the nineteenth century
              (even though the contemporary genre of steampunk, with its prolifera-
              tion of alternate Victorian realities, constitutes one of the more popular
              genres of its kind). Yet, as scholars are beginning to demonstrate, many
              writers of the period were fascinated, or troubled, by thoughts of alter-
              nate realities and multiple worlds. A little over a century before Squire
              assembled his collection of historical “What Ifs?”, for instance, Isaac
              D’Israeli proposed the writing of precisely such a work, to be titled “Of
              a History of Events Which Have not Happened” (in an 1824 essay of
              the same name), adducing scattered digressions in Livy and elsewhere
              as exemplary, if fragmentary, cases of counterfactual history avant la lettre.
              As both Catherine Gallagher and Ben Carver have recently shown, one
              imaginative exercise of particular fascination was the elaboration of
              “Napoleonic counterfactual[s]”,3 the nineteenth-century equivalent of
              later What-If? scenarios, in fiction and historiography, involving the
              American Civil War and WWII. Carver, whose excellent new book also
              considers topics ranging from evolutionary theory to the prospect of
              life on other planets, views nineteenth-century alternate histories as “a
              means to reflect on how scientific, cultural, and historical discoveries
              altered the understanding of the past.”4
                      Future work in Victorian studies will no doubt explore traces of the
              uchronian imagination in a wide variety of modes and genres. The scien-
              tific romance, certainly: Genie Babb, for instance, has classified
              H. G. Wells’s The Time Machine, The Sleeper Awakes, and In the Days of the
              Comet (along with William Morris’s News from Nowhere) as “future uchro-
              nias,” while describing A Modern Utopia, with its conceit of a parallel
              Earth, as a blend of the “alternate history” and “parallel worlds” tropes.5
              Closer to home (as it were), perhaps the most beloved fictional setting in
              all Victorian fiction might fruitfully be examined as an exercise in collec-
              tive counterfactual blending: as Thomas Hardy would write in a later
              preface to Far from the Madding Crowd, “The press and the public were
              kind enough to welcome the fanciful plan, and willingly joined me in
              the anachronism of imagining a Wessex population living under

                    who could read and write, and National school children.” In the realm
                    of the Gothic, fin-de-siècle writer Arthur Machen—an important
                    influence on Borges, and a reader of Edwin Abbott’s multidimensional
                    fantasy Flatland—conceptualized late-Victorian London as a disconcert-
                    ingly multiple space containing discrete, co-existing realities, as in his
                    1890 tale “The Lost Club.”6 Perhaps one day figurations of the alternate
                    and the counterfactual, of parallel and multiple worlds, will be studied
                    and taught alongside such better-known cultural phenomena as the dis-
                    covery of deep time and the emergence of evolutionary thought, as a
                    source of fascination, wonder, and unease in the Victorian world.

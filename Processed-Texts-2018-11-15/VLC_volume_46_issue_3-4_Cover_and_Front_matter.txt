                    VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE is a publication of Cambridge University Press. It is published
                    with the generous support of the University at Buffalo, SUNY.
                    Victorian Literature and Culture seeks to publish innovative scholarship of broad interest to the <U+FB01>eld. We are
                    especially interested in work that contributes or responds to the current moment of heightened method-
                    ological re<U+FB02>ection, theoretical energy, and formal experimentation. We welcome submissions that aim to
                    reimagine the <U+FB01>eld of Victorian studies in the twenty-<U+FB01>rst century, whether by interrogating the <U+FB01>eld’s
                    scope, boundaries, methods, and shibboleths; leveraging new or neglected conceptual resources; explor-
                    ing new archives; discovering or establishing new cross-<U+FB01>eld connections; or engaging anew with the
                    <U+FB01>eld’s own history. We are open to experiments in genre and form and welcome queries about the suit-
                    ability of particular submissions.

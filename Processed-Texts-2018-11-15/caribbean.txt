                   desires a mechanical fixing of the conditions of promotion” (963).

              TIM WATSON
              A      LTHOUGH I’m not sure Raymond Williams would approve, this
                      Victorian keyword essay begins with a twenty-first-century keyword
              search. Using the University of Miami’s Project Muse subscription, a search
              for “Caribbean” in the journal Victorian Studies since 2000 yields 46 items, of
              which only ten are full-length articles. Perhaps unsurprisingly for a field
              that embeds a British monarch in its name, keyword searches in Victorian
              Studies for British geographical locations result in far more hits: 243 for
              Edinburgh, 293 for Manchester, and 1,462 for London. By this measure,
              the Caribbean is about as important as Brighton (40) and Newcastle
              (47). When Victorian Studies focuses on imperial and international topics,
              India (389), America (348), Ireland (291), and Australia (208) count as
              much more important than the Caribbean. Comparisons to journals in
              American literary and cultural studies are instructive: Early American
              Literature (159 results for “Caribbean” since 2000) and Early American
              Studies (112 results since 2003) are far more Caribbean-focused. Most

                    strikingly, J19 (which unlike the two early American journals covers the
                    whole of the nineteenth century) has published as many full-length articles
                    (ten) with a Caribbean focus in its four years of existence as Victorian Studies
                    has in the last seventeen years. The unavoidable inference is that the
                    Caribbean remains marginal to Victorian studies, even as the Caribbean
                    region is growing in importance in nineteenth-century American studies.
                            One explanation for the dearth of Victorian scholarship on the
                    Caribbean is that the field simply reflects the neglect of the Caribbean
                    in Britain after the end of slavery in the 1830s. After the upheavals and
                    intense debates over the slave trade and slavery in the forty years before
                    Victoria came to the throne, the Caribbean did slip from public con-
                    sciousness in Britain, while India rose in imperial and economic impor-
                    tance. But if the region and its people were discussed less in Parliament
                    and in London and provincial newspapers, the continuing cultural
                    importance of the Caribbean is registered by its role in works by major
                    writers of the Victorian period: Jane Eyre and Vanity Fair most obviously,
                    but also in such novels as Treasure Island and Armadale. Periodically, the
                    Caribbean snapped back to the center of Victorian culture, most prom-
                    inently in the divisive debate over Governor Edward Eyre’s suppression
                    of the Morant Bay rebellion in Jamaica in 1865. More far-reachingly,
                    Catherine Hall and other historians involved in the influential Legacies
                    of British Slave-Ownership project have been arguing that the political,
                    economic, and cultural benefits that accrued to many Britons from
                    trade and capital accumulation in the West Indies profoundly shaped
                    nineteenth-century Britain long after the official emancipation of all
                    enslaved people in 1838.1 The fact that Victorians stopped talking
                    about the Caribbean did not mean that the region ceased to be signifi-
                    cant; indeed, the reluctance to talk about the region may have signaled
                    a discomfort on the part of many Britons in disclosing the source of their
                    economic, political, and cultural power. Victorianists therefore should be
                    focusing on the Caribbean much more than we currently do.
                            Victorianists should also be spending more time discussing works
                    in nineteenth-century Caribbean studies. As Caroline Levine points out,
                    in spite of “the wealth of transnational scholarship that has emerged in
                    Victorian literary studies . . . it is surprising that so much of the field remains
                    organized around British authors.”2 Faith Smith’s study of the late
                    nineteenth-century Trinidadian author John Jacob Thomas, Creole
                    Recitations (2002), generated a roundtable in the premier journal of
                    Caribbean studies, Small Axe, but was not reviewed in either Victorian
                    Studies or Victorian Literature and Culture, despite Thomas’s being best

              known for Froudacity, his caustic response to Victorian man of letters James
              Anthony Froude.3 Evelyn O’Callaghan’s Women Writing the West Indies,
              1804–1939 (2004) and Raphael Dalleo’s Caribbean Literature and the Public
              Sphere (2011) have likewise had significant impacts in Caribbean studies
              while going unreviewed in leading Victorian studies journals.4 These
              works, with their emphasis on creolization, racial formation, imperial identi-
              ties, and multilingual literary connections, would add significantly to
              Victorian studies, which remains too focused on Britain.
                      There is still a pressing need, in other words, to decolonize Victorian
              studies, even though many of the major works in Anglophone postcolonial
              literary studies have focused on the nineteenth century, such as Gauri
              Viswanathan’s Masks of Conquest and Outside the Fold, Ian Baucom’s
              Specters of the Atlantic, and of course Edward Said’s Culture and
              Imperialism.5 Perhaps we see signs of a nascent Caribbean turn in the
              field in the vibrant and positive response to Nathan Hensley’s Forms of
              Empire (2016), which devotes significant attention to the Morant Bay upris-
              ing and the Caribbean more broadly.6 Christopher Taylor’s forthcoming
              Empire of Neglect: The West Indies in the Wake of British Liberalism (2018)
              may signal a more wholehearted turn toward the Caribbean.7 Maybe schol-
              ars looking to the Caribbean will notice how few places in the region are
              named for Queen Victoria, in contrast to other former British colonies.
              Meanwhile, turning back to Britain, recent news suggests growing aware-
              ness of the historical interdependence of British and Caribbean places
              and people, throughout the nineteenth century and beyond, in line
              with Hall’s legacies of slave-ownership project. University of Liverpool stu-
              dents living in a residence hall named for one of Victorian Britain’s lead-
              ing politicians have launched a petition to rename Gladstone Hall, on the
              grounds that the source of William Gladstone’s family’s fortune in the slave
              trade and in Caribbean sugar plantations ought to disqualify him from the
              honor of presiding symbolically over an institution of higher learning.8 It
              remains to be seen whether Britain—not to mention the scholarly field of
              Victorian studies—is ready for the kind of reckoning with empire, slavery,
              and the Caribbean that would come with such a rethinking.

                             English corpus of the Google NGram viewer, which visualizes word fre-
                    quency across the corpus of books scanned by Google as of 2012, shows a
                    slow increase in the use of the word “data” in the nineteenth century,
                    with a dramatic spike around 1990 (see fig. 1). The Oxford English
                    Dictionary ties the rise of “data” specifically to the rise of computing and com-
                    puters in the mid-twentieth century. Data is collective. Now typically used as
                    a mass noun, data signifies related bits of information, usually numbers, con-
                    sidered collectively. Informally, data means any sort of digital information.
                            In this essay, I use digital humanities methods to collect data about the
                    Victorian novel. Concentrating on Anthony Trollope’s third Chronicle of
                    Barsetshire, Doctor Thorne, I examine what social media traces on
                    Goodreads, a popular social cataloguing site where users review and recom-
                    mend books to friends, can tell us about the way we read Victorian litera-
                    ture now. In doing so, I hope to uncover information about a collective
                    everyday Victorianism. While previous work in reader response theory suf-
                    fered from the difficulty of obtaining data on how people read, for the first

              time, Goodreads offers us “a large-scale network of serious readers and their
              readings with the attendant metadata” in James English’s words.1 Lisa
              Nakamura remarks that “scholars looking to study reading culture ‘in
              the wild’ will be rewarded by a close study of Goodreads.”2
                      Doctor Thorne is an interesting case study at this cultural moment
              because Julian Fellowes chose to dramatize Trollope’s novel in the wake
              of his enormously popular period drama, Downton Abbey. Fellowes’s
              announcement that he would adapt Doctor Thorne provoked an immediate
              spike in tweets about Trollope in May 2015.3 However, it was not until
              Doctor Thorne actually aired, in March 2016 on ITV in the U. K. and on
              Amazon Prime in May 2016 in the U. S., that Goodreads saw an increased
              number of users reviewing the novel.4 Eighty of the top 300 reviews of
              Doctor Thorne appeared in 2016, as opposed to 23 to 25 reviews per year
              each of the previous three years. Those who read Doctor Thorne generally
              liked it, of 4,095 users who rated the novel, 76% gave it four or five stars
              out of a possible five, while only 4% gave it two stars or less.5
                      For a general audience, Trollope, with his focus on marriage and money
              and his smooth prose style, seems to be a natural successor to Jane Austen,
              who has been endlessly adapted in the past 25 years. Austen was by far the
              author that reviewers most frequently compared Trollope to; she is men-
              tioned 49 times in the top 300 reviews, followed by Charles Dickens at 26 men-
              tions, and George Eliot at 9. Users also included Doctor Thorne on lists devoted
              to “What to Read After You’ve Finished Jane Austen” and “More for the Jane
              Austen Purist,” where they collaboratively ranked Trollope’s novel as 157 out
              of 334 books and 47 out of 98 books respectively.6 As one reviewer put it:
              “How am I almost 35 and just experienced the wry fun of a Trollope novel?
              Seriously, next time you see a nerdy thirteen-year-old clutching Austen and
              Dickens, be sure to put some Trollope in her hands as well.”7

                            Despite the strong connection between Austen, Trollope, and adap-
                    tation, it would be a mistake to presume that general readers are only in
                    it for the costume drama. Although the 2016 miniseries seems to have
                    prompted many to read the novel, this was not what they focused on
                    in their reviews. Only forty-one, or 13.67%, of the top 300 written reviews
                    mentioned the adaptation. By contrast, 151, or 50.33%, of reviewers
                    expressed familiarity with Trollope’s oeuvre in general, either intimating
                    (“I do really enjoy Trollope; there is something quite soothing and stim-
                    ulating both in watching his novels march along to their ordered end-
                    ing”) or directly stating that they had read or were at least familiar with
                    some of Trollope’s other novels (“I’ve read 99 percent of the trollopes,
                    even the obscure ones, and this one is my absolute favorite”).8
                            Love (of Trollope, of his characters, or of the book in general) was
                    the main theme that came up in written reviews. Yet, reviewers were actu-
                    ally about as likely to mention Trollope’s style (which they compared to
                    “butter” and “silk”) as love of his characters (the “marvellously irreverent”
                    Miss Dunstable, mentioned 29 times, was universally liked).9 Delving
                    deeper into Trollopian style, many readers found Trollope amusing,
                    with 65 of 300 reviewers mentioning enjoying his humour. By contrast,
                    the narrator alternately amused and infuriated readers. As one reader
                    put it, “even with all his Victorian mansplaining, Trollope and I might
                    be friends after all.”10 And of, course, many readers found Trollope
                    dull, though not everyone thought this was a bad thing: “The plot is
                    like taking a familiar train ride: one knows where one is going to wind
                    up, and one knows where all the stops are going to be. The pleasure is
                    in watching the scenery (i.e., the characters) go by.”11
                            Some scholars have theorized that literature which enters the canon
                    becomes depoliticized over time, appreciated for its aesthetic qualities
                    rather than its political commentary.12 This is not so with Doctor Thorne,
                    which many read as a form of social critique. Eighty-nine reviews men-
                    tioned Trollope’s skewering of the British class system, money, and mar-
                    riage; many of these readers wondered whether Mary’s inheritance
                    undermined Trollope’s criticism of the class system, others were disturbed
                    that Scatcherd’s downfall seemed to be a punishment for his social ascen-
                    dancy. Fewer readers made a direct connection to the present day, but it
                    seems that Trollope functioned equally well as an escape from and a cri-
                    tique on the 2016 U. S. election. Readers commented that “it was the per-
                    fect escape from post-inauguration depression.”13 One reviewer wrote that
                    rereading the novel “provides great insight into the carnival of politics
                    today”;14 another compared Sir Roger Scatcherd, “a boorish construction

                      Reading Trollope by the numbers, a mode the highly regimented
              novelist surely would have appreciated, reveals an appreciation amongst
              general readers of not only the marriage plot and his characters, but
              also of his style and his social commentary. Numbers may be on the
              upswing as evidence in literary studies; Andrew Goldstone and Ted
              Underwood point out that after a century of decline in mentions of num-
              ber words in scholarly articles, there appears to be an upturn in the use
              of numbers.16 Social media data has the potential to transform the way
              we read Victorian literature now, illuminating the way our objects of
              study are read outside the classroom.

                     books on Amazon were scant and influenced fewer than 10% of read-

                     lected on 27 October 2017. Goodreads allows users to add books, which
                     can result in several different editions in the database (though the

                                                                                                        DECADE NCE                  637
              I   N a recent review of Matthew Potolsky’s The Decadent Republic of Letters
                   (2012) and Vincent Sherry’s Modernism and the Reinvention of Decadence
              (2015), Richard Kaye wonders if we might be witnessing the onset of a
              “new decadent studies,” “a decisive point similar to that of modernist
              studies in the 1990s, when a monolithic ‘modernism’ was toppled in
              the wake of scholarly accounts accentuating diverse, contradictory
              strains.”2 This kind of work is certainly welcome, as it has allowed us to
              see a Decadence that extends beyond boundaries of nation and period
              and to locate Decadence in surprising and unlikely places. Decadence
              is a concept that invites, or even necessitates, the kind of thinking Kaye
              describes, definitional work that allows for diversity and contradiction.
              It is, as Arthur Symons reminds us, a restless aesthetic that “piles over-
              subtilizing refinement upon refinement.”3 It pushes back against order,
              restraint, and categorization. It is perversely christened after the concept
              of decay, and it highlights deterioration, meaning Decadence fore-
              grounds decline but it also revels in the dissolution of edges and fron-
              tiers. In terms of periodization, it is a point of dissolve between the
              nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the richest area of contact between
              our period and the next, a movement that forces us to confront the arbi-
              trariness of the Victorian/modern divide. Decadence’s cosmopolitanism
              and its more troubling Orientalism emerge from its tendency to glory in
              the disintegration of national perimeters at a moment of globalization.
              Decadence engenders a style in which “the page decomposes to make
              way for the independence of the sentence” and “the unity of the book
              falls apart.”4 And the movement is, of course, known first and foremost
              for accelerating the corrosion of conventional sexual and gender ideolo-
              gies and reveling in the sloughing off of fixed categories of identity and
              desire. It is a movement that welcomed confusion and thus forces us to
              work within the realm of confusion, with challenging, intricate, and
              excessive forms, outside the limits of our period and of any one national
              tradition, and with an understanding that we may be unable to place or
              fix the way these authors and artists conceived of affiliation or eroticism.
                      All of this is very exciting, but it means that almost every monograph
              on Decadence must at some point engage in obligatory hand-wringing
              about the difficulty of defining the term. In this, Decadence resembles
              its close friend “camp,” a sensibility whose elusiveness forced Susan
              Sontag to resort to notes and lists of “random examples,” a mode of def-
              inition that insists upon its own fragmentation and inadequacy and seems
              to say, “Of course we can’t actually delineate this concept, but here is this

                    list of things. Can’t you see how camp they are?”5 Sontag’s list includes
                    lots of Decadent and post-Victorian Decadent things (Zuleika Dobson
                    [1911], Aubrey Beardsley’s drawings, the novels of Ronald Firbank and
                    Ivy Compton-Burnett), and the notes themselves are “for Oscar Wilde,”
                    implying that Decadence’s dissolution and disintegration, its resistance
                    to definition, has infected the camp sensibility.6 If Decadence is a “beau-
                    tiful and interesting disease,” its symptoms seem to include disorienta-
                    tion, and the malady is contagious.7
                            This disorientation makes writing an entry like this one challenging,
                    especially as I would only want to extend, rather than delimit, the accentu-
                    ation of diverse and contradictory strains of Decadence that Kaye describes.
                    The contribution I would like to make to the ongoing (and perpetually
                    incomplete) work of defining Decadence should not be understood as a
                    move toward shutting down the borders of Decadence or shutting out
                    any of the figures or texts that have recently been welcomed into the
                    fold. Highlighting another manner in which Decadence resembles
                    camp, I would simply like to emphasize that Decadence is often funny.
                    With this in mind, I wish to propose that we include Max Beerbohm’s
                    “A Defence of Cosmetics” (1894) among the constellation of foundational
                    texts used to establish a definition of Decadence, a set that more typically
                    includes Pater’s “Conclusion” to Studies in the History of the Renaissance
                    (1873), Symons’s “The Decadent Movement in Literature” (1893), and
                    Bourget’s essay on Baudelaire (1881).
                            In his “Defence,” Beerbohm, parodically echoing Baudelaire’s
                    “Éloge du Maquillage” (1863), gleefully hails the decline of Victorian
                    innocence and simplicity and the onset of a new era of artifice as mani-
                    fested in the widespread use of cosmetics. While he marveled in a
                    follow-up, “A Letter to the Editor” (1894), that anyone managed to
                    take such an excessive celebration of rouge seriously, he continued to
                    taunt moralistic readers with the threat that British literature would
                    “fall at length into the hands of the decadents,” making it clear that
                    he at once did and did not mean what he had said.8 Placing a text that
                    has such a complex and double relationship to Decadence, at once satir-
                    ical and affectionate, at the center of the aesthetic might only stand to
                    further trouble our ability to define this movement. But what is to be
                    gained, I would argue, by understanding Beerbohm’s “Defence” as a
                    foundational text within, rather than only a parody of, the Decadent tra-
                    dition is clearer insight into the extent to which Decadence is so often
                    laughing at itself, finding itself hilarious. Wilde, Beardsley, and
                    Beerbohm enact such an exaggerated form of Decadence that they

              often appear to be lampooning the very aesthetic they are known for creat-
              ing. Like “a woman walking around in a dress made of three million feath-
              ers,” the excesses of Salome (1891) are funny.9 Beardsley’s terminal god
              with eyes for nipples is funny.10 Even the most seemingly earnest forms of
              minor Decadence practice the aesthetic in such an exaggerated fashion
              that laughter seems to be the only appropriate response. R. Murray
              Gilchrist’s horrifying Decadent landscapes, for example, are populated
              with “satyrs vomiting senilely,” which is also funny.11 Including burlesques
              of Decadence, such as Beerbohm’s “Defence,” within the Decadent canon
              makes the boundaries of the movement dissolve even further, but this
              draws out the camp sensibility within works we have tended to hail as fully
              and authentically Decadent. When we rely primarily on the somewhat
              humorless Symons for our definition of Decadence, much of this is lost.
                      Attending to the humor in Decadence, I would argue, is crucial
              because it is its camp qualities, its irony, and its derisive laughter that
              underwrite most of what attracts us to the movement today. If we are
              interested at this moment in speaking about form, about a transnational
              Victorian studies, about gender and sexual dissidence, about Victorian
              modernism, focusing on the camp excesses of Decadence enables us
              to do so. The “curved line[s],” “extravagant gesture[s],” and rococo sty-
              listic qualities of Decadent writing; the parodic reimagining of
              Decadence on the part of writers in the Harlem Renaissance; the exces-
              sive performances of gender and the operatic treatment of desire; and
              the afterlife of Wilde and Beardsley in the camp modernism of the
              early twentieth century are all phenomena that highlight the centrality
              of camp humor to Decadence.12 When we foreground Decadence’s
              detachment, irony, derision, and laughter, it is much easier to see how
              this aesthetic enabled resistance to troubling forms of earnestness,
              such as nationalism, moralism, and the depth model of identity. Its
              power came from its refusal to take power seriously.

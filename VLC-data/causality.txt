              “If the plate layer were accurate, and if the trains were punctual, and if
              the work were successful, and if the signals were properly placed, and
              if the day were not too bright nor yet too foggy, and if the engine driver
              were always looking out, and if the breaks [sic] were patent, the train
              might be safe; but a failure in one of these elements might render all
              the rest abortive.” This enumeration of the multiple, interdependent
              conditions and circumstances underlying railway safety was as much a sar-
              castic indictment of “modern railway management” as a recognition of
              the difficulty of assigning a single cause within what the article terms
              such a “complex system.”1
                      Literary critics have often associated the representation of com-
              plex causality with twentieth-century narrative. Brian Richardson, for
              example, investigating what he calls “one of the most neglected and
              undertheorized topics of narrative theory and criticism,” situates his
              study of causality in the twentieth century, when “the first major cracks
              in the mechanistic causal models so diligently constructed” in earlier
              periods appeared.2 So, too, while recognizing that Modernism’s
              “increasing specificity, multiplicity, complexity, probability, and uncer-
              tainty of causal knowledge” has nineteenth-century origins, Stephen
              Kern nonetheless locates a critical “historical pivot” in causal under-
              standing only at the century’s end.3 Still, critics like Gillian Beer
              and George Levine have uncovered how fully Victorian writers—
              Darwin, Dickens, Eliot, among others—acknowledged the role of
              chance and how they moved beyond the teleologies, both theological
              and scientific, that had governed earlier narratives.4 A key figure in
              both critics’ accounts, Darwin expanded the period’s understanding
              of causality not only by envisioning its secular modes of action but
              also by extending its temporal scope. The vision he offers in his best-
              known work (which in fact traces not origins but causes) reads like an
              inversion of the Times article, the latter’s dismay replaced by wonder.
              But in both lies a recognition that long, complex causalities might
              become legible in singularity: “we regard every production of nature
              as one which has had a history; . . . we contemplate every complex
              structure and instinct . . . exactly in the same way as when we look
              at any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour,
              the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous
              workmen.”5
                      What would it mean to look upon the productions of the world, as
              these two writers do, as systems, as summings-up of multiple, intertwined
              causes? An appreciation for complex causality took shape, we suggest,

                    across Victorian scientific, technological, and literary discourse, which
                    investigated the decidedly non-mechanistic ways in which causes oper-
                    ated: the incremental, slow causalities of early-Victorian geology and nat-
                    ural history; the distributed, often latent causalities cited in technological
                    failure; the distant causalities traced by epidemiological writing; the over-
                    determined causalities of accidents. Narrative could reveal what was
                    invisible—causalities otherwise hidden by time and distance—but it
                    also had the power to constitute relationships, to conjure through causal
                    explanation an intricate and “complex system.”
                            With a range and complexity often exceeding what the report,
                    history, or novel typically allowed, causal explanation also came to test
                    the very limits of narrative. The size and length of works like Lyell’s
                    Principles of Geology and Dickens’s Bleak House, their incremental publica-
                    tion and the reader’s incremental progress, all attest to the challenge of
                    representing slow causalities. Lyell dramatizes the gradual, otherwise
                    invisible geological processes on the page, animating the formation of
                    new seas or the rising of layers of earth, whose occurrence is otherwise
                    “only present to our minds by the aid of reflection.”6 Bleak House enacts
                    its own slow process, its marriage and detection plots unfurling over
                    many chapters, through the long causalities of inheritance and descent,
                    of personal memory, social pressures, and intertwined lives. Encouraging
                    readers to look beyond the local and the proximate, Victorian novels
                    uncovered not causes but rather causalities, the “operation[s] or rela-
                    tion[s] of cause and effect.”7 Who can say, Eliot’s narrator in
                    Middlemarch might have asked, what “causes” Nicholas Bulstrode’s down-
                    fall or Dorothea Brooke’s second marriage, what combination of circum-
                    stances, coincidences, emotions, motives, and events?
                            Explanations of the preeminent technological accidents of the
                    age—railway disasters—similarly tested the limits of narrative, just as
                    they resisted translation into familiar forms like melodrama.8 Official
                    accident reports struggled to trace lines of causation that linked the
                    actions of people and machines to catastrophic events. Their explana-
                    tions often overflowed the columns of the neat tabular forms that
                    recorded the date, victims, “nature” and “cause” of Victorian railway acci-
                    dents. In his detailed investigation of the 1844 Shields accident, the offi-
                    cial inspector, Joshua Coddington, confessed that he was forced to start
                    “a little wide of the mark,” with a short history of the railway, its economic
                    failures, the dilapidated state of its engines, and the sequence of freak
                    coincidences and human errors that sent trains headlong into each
                    other on the morning of 8 October.9 These reports identified a cast of

              characters—not only tragic victims but partially-redeemed culprits: intel-
              ligent but overworked signalmen and panicked engine-drivers. They
              implicated features of landscape—icy inclines; collapsed slopes; blind
              turns. And they focused heavily on the properties and behavior of
              materials, pointing to latent flaws in cast iron, “marks of violence,”
              “points of fracture,” and carefully reconstructed accident scenes.10
              Through their sometimes tortured narration of accidents, they assembled
              the complex systems that coordinated humans and materials to produce
              the unforeseen and the unforeseeable.
                      These systems of narration and narrated systems signaled a new
              overdetermination in Victorian causality. They furnished structures of
              culpability and causation that increasingly allowed material causes to
              be substituted for human causes and vice versa.11 By the 1860s, the
              Victorian popular press mirrored these understandings, as the
              Staplehurst accident showed. By the time of the catastrophic 1868
              Abergele accident, the Saturday Review warned that the complex, over-
              determined causation created by the railway system had made accidents
              inevitable: “It is as though railway accidents were, of some set purpose, so
              arranged and diversified as to make the impossible possible, and to
              exhaust every conceivable, or even inconceivable, variety of the remotest
              and most unlikely danger.” In an appeal to the emerging science of the
              indeterminate, the article argued that Quetelet himself would have been
              hard-pressed to calculate the probabilities involved.12
                      These literary, bureaucratic, and journalistic accounts situated
              events within a wider geography of social, temporal, and spatial relations,
              one implicated not only in traditional concerns about the individual,
              technologies, gender, and social class, but also in changing ideas about
              probability, causation, and the potentialities of complex systems.13 In
              doing so, they also created distinctively modern explanatory structures
              for thinking about responsibility, accident, and social order in an age
              of complex causality.14

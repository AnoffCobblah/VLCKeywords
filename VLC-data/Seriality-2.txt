              Seriality
              LAUREN M. E. GOODLAD
              T      O a greater extent than any short-form medium, serialized narratives
                     create a real-life experience of inhabiting uncertain worlds whose
              storylines thwart our longings for knowledge and plenitude. That is partly
              because serial narratives tend to generate multiple plots that “divide the
              fictional world” and “disperse the reader’s attention.”1 In place of formal
              unity as it is typically conceived, multiplot narratives generalize by cross-
              ing discrete storyworlds to ramify particular thematic, stylistic, and spatial
              perceptions. Nonetheless, serialization also entails the capacity to choreo-
              graph “what bodies do in time and space,” producing shared aesthetic,
              affective, and intellectual engagements.2 The Victorian practice of pub-
              lishing new part issues on “Magazine Day,” for example, created “large
              communities of readers.”3 As Linda K. Hughes and Michael Lund have
              observed, “We need to see the serial taking place amidst many different
              texts, and many different voices.”4
                      With decades of research into print cultures to build on, today’s
              scholars increasingly study serialization from transtemporal, transna-
              tional, and transmedia perspectives. Their inspiration is partly that new
              TV “golden age” that HBO’s The Sopranos (1999–2007) helped to usher
              in.5 In the decade since, serial television has become a global phenome-
              non. As scholars take up seriality as a lens on past and present, compar-
              isons between Charles Dickens’s Bleak House (1852–53) and David
              Simon’s The Wire (2002–08) have crossed from classrooms and confer-
              ences to watercoolers and The Atlantic Monthly.6 We are reminded that
              the format of twenty monthly parts which came into being when
              Dickens persuaded Chapman and Hall to expand a series of sketches
              into what became The Pickwick Papers (1836–37), was not only a formida-
              ble profit-making machine. It was also a means of turning periodicals
              into vehicles for “quality fiction.”7 Boz’s publishers, succeeded by such
              aspirants to prestige as The Cornhill and Fortnightly Review, thus anticipated
              HBO in garnering acclaim for the wares of a platform long thought to
              purvey mass entertainments lacking cultural capital or artistic éclat.
                      That said, it is not Dickens, but Anthony Trollope who, according to
              the New Yorker, is the “trending” Victorian whose works most befit the way
              we live now.8 Trollope’s ascent in the heyday of serial television prompts
              us to consider the author’s status as the English-speaking world’s fore-
              most progenitor of the nineteenth-century roman fleuve. Of course, the

                    most famous “novel river” is Honoré de Balzac’s La Comédie humaine,
                    which, at more than ninety works, far exceeds the seven or eight seasons
                    of the longest-running television serials. By contrast, Trollope’s
                    Barsetshire and Palliser sequences, each composed of six novels over
                    twelve- or fifteen-year spans respectively, offer stronger parallels to The
                    Sopranos’ six seasons in seven years, or The Wire’s five seasons in six years.
                            If Trollope stands out as the ideal nineteenth-century novelist for
                    comparing then and now, it is worth noting that the author had not
                    yet serialized any novel before he was invited to write for the Cornhill’s
                    inaugural issue. Framley Parsonage (1860–61)—the work that elevated
                    George Smith’s new magazine into an industry leader and Trollope to
                    a first-tier novelist—was the fourth Barsetshire chronicle, but it was
                    only the first to be serialized. Perhaps as Smith and his editor, William
                    Makepeace Thackeray, sought the right novel for their debut, they grav-
                    itated toward the only British writer at the time who was extending stories
                    and characters across works as well as parts. What we know for certain is
                    that Smith’s request for “an English tale” with “a clerical flavour” called
                    for another Barsetshire novel in spirit if not in letter.9
                            To be sure, when Trollope first seized on the idea for The Warden
                    (1855), he did not anticipate writing six novels set in the same imaginary
                    county. Yet, by the time critics reviewed The Last Chronicle of Barset (1866–
                    67), they found Josiah Crawley’s narrative ordeal woven into such ongo-
                    ing storylines as Mr. Harding’s life after his wardenship, Mrs. Proudie’s
                    rule of her husband’s diocese, Lily Dale’s refusal to accept John
                    Eames, and Archdeacon Grantly’s ever-strenuous attempts to rein in
                    the forces of modernity. Trollope’s return to Barsetshire after a four-year
                    hiatus, produced a warm meditation on series form. The Barchester nov-
                    els, wrote The Literary Examiner, are both “the best set of ‘sequels’ in our
                    literature” and a new phenomenon; whereas Homer’s epics and
                    Aeschylus’s tragedies were “complete stories,” Trollope’s “chain of nov-
                    els” is “essentially a birth of our own time.”10 The advantage of this
                    mode of seriality, wrote The Athenaeum, is a “remarkable substance and
                    vitality.”11
                            If such comments tell against Henry James’s still-influential critique
                    of Trollope’s supposed lack of formal interest,12 they also open pathways
                    for transtemporal and transmedia comparison. The “last news from the
                    Cathedral-close . . . has now reached us” declared the British Quarterly
                    Review, as though beckoning aficionados to join the discussion of a pop-
                    ular finale.13 By populating the “homogeneous” and “empty” time-space
                    of modernity with “endeared” scenes, situations, and characters,14 such

              serials, in the words of the London Review “inspire . . . gentle melancholy”
              on their closing.15 Long-form serials (even if we consume them rapidly)
              mark time’s passage through purposeful pauses between chapters and
              installments while staging dialectical movement between parts and
              wholes. The sync between narrative time and the lived time of audiences
              which they accentuate, invites communities of conversation around
              shared temporal, affective, and aesthetic experience.
                      As the London Review put it, “If this really be . . . the last chronicle of
              Barset,” “we cannot but feel grieved . . . to say farewell.” “Barset has long
              been a real country”: the “voices of the people . . . known to our ears, and
              the pavements . . . familiar to our footsteps.”16 For comparative
              nineteenth-centuryists working across the longue durée,17 the study of
              seriality invites continued exploration of untapped archives and new
              ways of understanding familiar works in light of dialogues with our
              own fast-transforming material culture.

                    I    N the opening of this brief polemic, I must acknowledge conscious
                          bias: as of 5 a.m. on the morning after the Brexit referendum, I am
                    a card-carrying member of the Scottish National Party. This was not antic-
                    ipated. Brought up in Belfast as an Ulster-Scots Unionist with a determi-
                    nation to be “British” rather than “Irish,” and educated in the most
                    English of institutions, I am now in the awkward position of being
                    grateful for the Irish state’s continuing political claim on Northern
                    Ireland, which renders me an EU citizen. Once, I was clear that I was
                    British. Now, I am not so sure. Once, I considered myself a scholar of
                    Victorian Britain. Now, I am increasingly aware that up until 2013 I was
                    exclusively a scholar of Victorian England, and, in the present moment,
                    my research is strongly aligned with “Scottish studies,” a field which has
                    had surprisingly little dialogue with “Victorian studies.”
                            In recent years, the field of Victorian literature and culture has
                    seen crucial, transformative work on global Victorian studies, world
                    Victorianism, transnational, transatlantic, transcultural, and cosmopoli-
                    tan Victorian studies. This has involved substantial questioning of nation-
                    alisms and national boundaries. What I want to suggest, however, is that
                    in placing British literature within a more “global” concept of Victorian
                    literature and culture, the complexities of national, regional and local
                    identities within “Victorian Britain” have sometimes been subsumed or
                    ignored. How many works of scholarship on British-based writers or
                    texts are published each year in which the phrases “Victorian culture”
                    and “Victorian literature” actually mean English culture and literature?
                    Are we in danger of reproducing a clustering of resources not simply
                    towards England, but towards London and the south of England,
                    which has been increasingly recognized and critiqued in twenty-first

              century British politics and society, and was far from unproblematic in
              the nineteenth century?
                      As a very crude indication of the likely answer to this question,
              searching the MLA database for keywords from 1990–2017 produces
              657 combinations of “Victorian” and “England,” 328 for “Victorian”
              and “Britain,” 60 for “Victorian” and “Ireland,” 31 for “Victorian” and
              “Scotland,” and 23 for “Victorian” and “Wales.” With 133 results,
              “Victorian” and “India” outweighs Scotland, Wales, and Ireland com-
              bined; “Victorian” and “London” produces three times as many results
              (468) as those on Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. “Scottish” in combination
              with “Victorian” seems more promising, with 475 results (“Welsh” pro-
              duces 81). But, this is in comparison to 1547 results for “Irish” and
              “Victorian.” The results for “nineteenth” as a search term are similar:
              58 for Wales, 83 for Scotland, 177 for Ireland, and 656 for England
              (296 for London). More anecdotally, searching major journals and
              rereading The Year’s Work in English Studies for the last five years suggests
              that work on Ireland and Victorian literature is reasonably healthy, with
              recent book-length publications including Tina O’Toole’s The Irish New
              Woman, Matthew Campbell’s Irish Poetry Under the Union, and Christina
              Morin and Niall Gillespie’s edited Irish Gothic. Nineteenth-century Irish
              history has also benefited from new revisionary work, especially con-
              cerned with Ireland in Britain and the wider world, by K. Theodore
              Hoppen, Niall Whelehan, Fintan Cullen, Barry Crosbie, and others.1
                      Work on Wales and Welsh literature, and indeed on Welsh history in
              the period, appears far more limited. We might consider Annmarie
              Drury’s discussion of Lady Charlotte Guest’s translation of the
              Mabinogion, in Translation as Transformation in Victorian Poetry, under
              this heading, and M. Wynn Thomas’s new The Nations of Wales: 1890–
              1914 is in part “Victorian” in scope, but, broadly speaking, the field of
              Victorian Wales remains very small. Work on Victorian Scottish literature
              and culture is also limited, though collections such as Scotland and the
              19th-Century World may indicate a small-scale revival.2 At this moment,
              however, it is fair to say that considerably more scholars of Victorian
              literature and culture are researching Victorian London than are
              researching any other part of the British Isles.
                      I am not necessarily suggesting that we need to redress this balance
              but that we need to acknowledge and interrogate its existence. Turning
              to Caroline Levine’s brilliant and influential essay, “From Nation to
              Network,” for instance, Levine rightly asks us to consider “why Britain
              especially matters,” and notes that scholars “whose work stays within

                    Britain often say nothing about the national frame.”3 But the national
                    frame she refers to as “British” is implicitly English, since there is no men-
                    tion of the gradual development of alternate “national frames” in
                    Scotland and Wales. If—as I entirely agree—there is a problem in allow-
                    ing the assumption that “Victorian” authors are “born in Britain” to go
                    unrecognized, there is another problem in suggesting that writers born
                    in Scotland or Wales would have necessarily considered themselves
                    “British-born.”4 What did the “national frame” look like from the per-
                    spective of networks of literary production centred on Glasgow, or
                    Cardiff? Is “British-born” the right term for Highland poets writing rad-
                    ical political protest verse in Gaelic? Unlike Irish literature, which does
                    tend to be carefully acknowledged as a separate tradition, writers who
                    identified as Scottish and Welsh, especially if they lived in Scotland or
                    Wales and lacked access to London’s resources, are often rendered invis-
                    ible in scholarship by a “British” framework.
                            This critique is of course not confined to Victorian studies, as it is a
                    broader concern of “new British” or “four nations” history.5 But it was
                    also a complaint made with increasing frequency by Victorian writers,
                    though often in reverse: rather than objecting that “Britain” was synony-
                    mous with “England,” writers protested that “England” was used when
                    “Britain” was intended. In 1882, for instance, George Bruce, a St. Andrew’s
                    poet, vehemently condemned “the present fashion of falsifying History and
                    Geography, by substituting “England” for “Great Britain and Ireland””:
                    Bruce’s newspaper poem on the Highland Regiment in the Battle of
                    Tel-el-Kebir, in Egypt, argues that the battle was won “Caledonia’s style!”
                    and that newspaper reports describing this as an English victory sought to
                    conceal “auld Scotland’s fame.” Yet, Bruce also argues that in winning this
                    imperial victory, Scotland demonstrated a greater loyalty to both “ancient
                    Britain” and the newer “Great Britain” than England did: “Britain’s soul in
                    Scotland lies!”6 As historian Graeme Morton has most trenchantly argued,
                    this kind of “unionist nationalism” complicates both our sense of
                    Britishness and of Scottish (and indeed Welsh and Ulster) nationalism in
                    the Victorian period.7
                            At a moment when the long-term future of the United Kingdom and
                    Great Britain in their current forms appears doubtful, it is important to
                    notice how Britain’s position on “Britain” is shaped by a specifically
                    Victorian history. When the Foreign Minister, a leading architect of
                    Brexit, sparks a major news story by inadvisably quoting Kipling’s
                    “Mandalay” from memory on a visit to Myanmar, this indicates a strand
                    of Victorian imperial nostalgia very evident in current fantasies of

              British freedom and independence outside the EU.8 When the Welsh
              leader of the openly xenophobic and British nationalist UKIP party
              poses by a Chartist statue, arguing that UKIP are the heirs of Chartism,
              currents of Victorian working-class radicalism and nationalism intersect
              (or clash) with the forms these currents take in twenty-first century
              Wales.9 Or, when the First Minister of Scotland argues that Scotland
              needs a separate immigration policy in order to offer “a welcoming
              hand and an open heart to those seeking to make a contribution here
              in Scotland,” she speaks to a different Victorian nationalism: the nascent
              Scottish rights movement and its preference for defining Scottish identity
              in terms of affiliation rather than birthplace.10 As Patrick Edward Dove
              declared at a meeting of the National Association for the Vindication
              of Scottish Rights in 1853, “Whoever—whatever man—whether he be
              black, white, red, or yellow, the moment he identifies with the institutions
              of Scotland, that moment he became a member of the Scottish nation,
              and Caledonia must throw around him the mantle of protection.”11
              Though “relevance” can be a dangerous concept, especially in U. K. aca-
              demia, both our students and ourselves might benefit from working with
              Victorian literature and culture to understand further what “Britain”
              meant for the four nations of the British isles, and what it means now,
              to and for Britain and the wider world.

              Generations
              TREV BROUGHTON AND HELEN KINGSTONE
                     HE term “generations” is everywhere. Successive demographic
              T      cohorts are construed as being in zero-sum competition over author-
              ity, airtime, resources, or power.1 In the British press, for instance, it is
              commonplace to see the interests of newly pensionable “babyboomers”
              pitted against those of “millennials,” and for such rivalry to be seen as
              personal, structural, or both. From serious sociological and economic
              analysis to pop-quiz punditry, it is taken for granted that the idea of a
              generation is useful. In cultural historiography, too, the term is ascribed
              explanatory force: first and second generation Romantic poets,
              “Bloomsbury” defying “Victorian,” and so on. In practice, however,
              such commentaries often rely on ahistorical assumptions about the
              meanings of age-identity (“child” versus “adult”), Freudian accounts of
              family structure (child vis-à-vis parent) and dialectical readings of

                    historical change (such as revolution/reaction). So does the term do
                    more than offer a crude signpost to social context and a checklist of
                    remembered ephemera?2 What is its value as a heuristic?
                            The term “generations” can point either laterally or vertically: across
                    to an imagined cohort stratum, or up/down to other generations. In lit-
                    erary theory the idea of strife between poets and their precursors,
                    broadly cast as sons and fathers in an Oedipal clinch and theorised
                    from the perspective of the sons, has had critical purchase since
                    Harold Bloom’s The Anxiety of Influence (1973).3 Retrospective accounts
                    of the Victorian period can appear to endorse the Bloomian paradigm:
                    think of the generational confrontations depicted in Samuel Butler’s The
                    Way of All Flesh (1903) or Edmund Gosse’s Father and Son (1907). Such
                    instances, however, suggest the contingency as well as the force of the
                    model—the likelihood, for example, that Butler’s and Gosse’s represen-
                    tations of generational conflict were shaped by their shared conscious-
                    ness of Darwinian thought.
                            This kind of vertical parent-child face-off may be most salient for
                    those with a collective identity to forge like the Bloomsbury set, or for
                    only children like Gosse junior. It is perhaps less relevant for daughters,
                    or in large multi-child families, where the older siblings may be raising
                    younger ones, or reaching maturity and having children of their own
                    while the youngest are still at home, or indeed in a working-class dynamic
                    where children join the wage-earning or productive part of the family. If
                    we consider the operative unit to be the household, the association or
                    neighborhood rather than some imagined version of the nuclear family,
                    the Oedipal model of generational competition comes under pressure.4
                            Since the Victorian period, the theorist arguing most forcibly for the
                    significance of generation as a sociological category was Karl Mannheim,
                    whose seminal essay “The Problem of Generations” (1952) asked his
                    reader to imagine “what the social life of man would be like if one gen-
                    eration lived on forever and none followed to replace it.”5 He used this
                    hypothetical scenario to demonstrate that the continual supersession of
                    one generation by another needed to be factored into analyses. While
                    his model has been criticised for oversimplifying and conflating age
                    and cohort,6 he acknowledges and challenges these distinctions: “do
                    we put the [Prussian] peasants, scattered as they are in remote districts
                    and almost untouched by current upheavals, in a common actual gener-
                    ation group with the urban youth of the same period? Certainly not! . . .
                    [But] they are similarly located, in so far as they are potentially capable of
                    being sucked into the vortex of social change.”7 Mannheim’s initial

              exploration thus offers a rallying point around which later scholars of
              generation have clustered.8
                      One of the few current Victorianists to take up Mannheim’s chal-
              lenge is Martin Hewitt, who has recently revived attention to this key-
              word, arguing that Victorianists use “generation” anachronistically. The
              Victorian period “offers few of the sorts of movements of generational
              revolt visible in the subsequent century, and indeed there was nothing
              in Victorian self-conceptions to match the readiness with which they
              themselves interpreted the contemporary history of the European conti-
              nent in broad generational patterns.” He suggests that Victorians them-
              selves understood generation as “less a matter of rupture than of
              modulation.” He shows for instance how the history of ideas maps onto
              the birth dates (and shared historical experiences) of contributors to
              high-status periodicals, highlighting “generational effects” that can
              include stagnation as well as change.9
                      Other scholars have followed similar lines of inquiry, though using
              the idea of generation less explicitly. Art historian Martin Myrone, for
              instance, has examined the cohorts of artists who enrolled at the Royal
              Academy Schools between 1760 and 1830 (a total of 1,600). Myrone
              observes that if we turn away from the striking or canonical figures of
              nineteenth-century British art—the Turners and Constables—and con-
              sider instead the “origins, social trajectory and values” of obscurer but
              more typical R. A. scholars, different determinations, and different gen-
              erational rhythms, become audible. Looking at institutional cohorts as a
              whole throws light on changing cultures of artistic practice and their
              dynamic relationship to other variables such as professionalization, mar-
              ket oversupply, embourgeoisement.10 Myrone’s project thus queries con-
              ventional periodization, and through this some of art history’s
              conventional wisdom. Mark Curthoys’ sampling of students matriculating
              at Oxford in selected years across the nineteenth century likewise enables
              him to identify moments of shift. He shows the third quarter of the cen-
              tury to be decisive in finally diversifying and secularizing Oxford gradu-
              ates’ career paths. Almost half of those who matriculated in 1818 and
              1848 went into the Church, whereas among the 1878 and 1897 year
              groups it fell to 29% and 18%.11 By contrast, the landed families only
              lost their dominance in the student body in the wake of the 1870s agri-
              cultural depression.12
                      There has been a realization that the digitization of large data sets,
              and the “distant readings” of cohorts they allow, empower historians to
              gain a more granular picture of the links between structural change

                    and biographical profile, and hence perhaps a more objective account of
                    generational patterning.13 One such large online data set that offers a
                    window into how the late-Victorians saw preceding generations is the
                    Dictionary of National Biography (1885–1900), a key tool in a current pro-
                    ject by the authors. The DNB includes a disproportionate number of
                    entries on nineteenth-century individuals, suggesting that the urge to
                    commemorate these generations trumped deference to the recently
                    deceased.14 The peak of this trend was the birth year 1819, with a record-
                    breaking 244 entries. This apparently unusually eminent generation
                    born in 1819 includes Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, George Eliot, John
                    Ruskin, war photographer Roger Fenton, radical Ernest Jones, “sewer
                    king” Joseph Bazalgette, and many more.15 Using this resource as a starting
                    point, and supplementing it with data collected by Helen Rogers from the
                    Burnett Archive of Working Class Autobiographies and other sources, we
                    hope to explore how these figures understood the relationship between
                    contemporaneity, age identity, and historical consciousness. While these
                    individuals are often considered separately, they are rarely recognized as
                    exact contemporaries. Nor are they often seen in their Regency context,
                    born in the inauspicious year of Peterloo. Examining these figures as
                    part of a generation, however, can recast our sense of periodization and
                    offer us Victorians before they knew they were Victorian.

                            31/victorian-generations/. Hewitt confirms our sense that the antag-
                            onism between late-Victorian and early twentieth-century cultural
                            formations has retroactively shaped our sense of earlier generational
                            configurations: “If we look at the Edwardian period we can see it being
                            marked by . . . the active adoption of generational identities by protago-
                            nists; the development of lateral generational solidarities; and the
                            greater sense of the narrowing and specificity of the generational layers
                            that operated in society” (Martin Hewitt, “BAVS 2015 Keynote: Victorian

                            1914” likewise posited that early theories of generational change were
                            themselves generational, “influenced, if not inspired, by the example
                            of the generation of 1914” (Robert Wohl, The Generation of 1914

                            Victorian periodization/modernist generation debate is offered by
                            Barbara Caine, who argues that despite being embedded in Victorian
                            cultural formations, the intellectuals of Bloomsbury typically saw the
                            end of the Victorian period as the crucial historiographical punctuation
                            point, and one that signified “the passing of the world of their parents
                            and the coming into being of their own generation.” See Barbara

              MELISSA VALISKA GREGORY
              I   S genre a restrictive or productive mode of interpretation for Victorian
                   literature? While twentieth-century theorists such as Benedetto Croce
              and Jacques Derrida mistrusted genre as a conservative edict that policed
              literature’s borders and denied its dynamism, literary scholars who take
              up genre these days often contend that it is the prime source of a literary
              text’s creative and social energy. Metaphors of activity and fluidity dom-
              inate the current scholarly discourse, framing genre as a live action event,
              a complex of shifting forces rather than an inert shape or static label. No
              longer merely a means of taxonomic stabilization that consigns a text
              once and for all to a proper grouping, genre is now what Carolyn
              Williams calls a process of “dynamic formation” or what John Frow
              describes as a “recurrent” performance.1 Classification remains central
              in that genre still depends on the idea that texts can be meaningfully
              organized and grouped according to their shared attributes, but scholars
              have recast classification as generative and productive, illuminating the
              ways genre allows for richer modes of both literary interpretation and cre-
              ation. Today’s genre studies, in other words, view taxonomic groupings as
              shaping and producing knowledge about literature rather than

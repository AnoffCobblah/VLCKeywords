              Seriality
              SUSAN DAVID BERNSTEIN
              T      HE Victorian serial form has been the subject of diverse scholarly
                     explorations, most often engaging with print culture and book history,
              since the publishing industry in the mid-nineteenth century prompted an
              uptick in Victorian serial novels. The circulation of serials across national
              borders has also garnered excellent studies on the transatlantic circula-
              tions of serial novels.1 Although scholars have focused on other genres
              besides the novel that appeared in serial format, such as Alfred, Lord
              Tennyson’s Idylls of the King or Robert Browning’s The Ring and the Book,
              or even John Ruskin’s Unto this Last, the overwhelming object of interest

                    has been the serial novel.2 These investigations consider how the serial
                    novel, broken up in time and space with fixed pauses between published
                    installments, shapes both reading and writing practices.3
                            A few years ago I taught a graduate seminar titled “Seriality” in which
                    we pursued this topic in Victorian culture from kaleidoscopic perspectives:
                    M. E. Braddon’s The Doctor’s Wife (serialized in Temple Bar, 1864) as a rewrit-
                    ing, recycling, and Anglicized sequel to Gustave Flaubert’s Madame Bovary
                    (also serialized when initially published in France); George Eliot’s three
                    stories linked under the title Scenes of Clerical Life (Blackwood’s January to
                    November 1857); Anthony Trollope’s Can You Forgive Her? (serialized in
                    monthly parts 1864–1865); and George Henry Lewes’s Studies in Animal
                    Life (serialized in The Cornhill in 1860) to consider seriality in nature, spe-
                    cifically Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution through natural selection
                    as a serial narrative of sorts. The concept as well as its historical print prac-
                    tices invited surprising connections and applications.
                            The psychoanalytic concept of transference suggests a wholly different
                    way of exploring seriality. The novel issued in parts, with installments punc-
                    tuated by regular pauses, encourages the back-and-forthness of transfer-
                    ence and countertransference, just as these regular gaps and returns also
                    shape our own affective oscillations between fiction and world. How is trans-
                    ference a serial phenomenon?4 In the traditional meaning of the term
                    transference, the patient puts the analyst in the place of a parent, a primary
                    person from early life. This putting-in-place structures the analytic experi-
                    ence so that “analysis without transference is an impossibility.”5 Sigmund
                    Freud makes even broader claims for transference where we can see its pur-
                    chase in the serial act of reading fiction: “It is a universal phenomenon of
                    the human mind,” one that “dominates the whole of each person’s rela-
                    tions to his human environment.”6 Transference behaves as a tool of sug-
                    gestion that bridges emotional relations to people outside and within the
                    walls of the consulting room. Analysis, as an interpretive enterprise, reveals
                    this convergence of outside and inside. Reading novels does much the
                    same thing as the transference where a series of worlds, fictional and dis-
                    tant, on the one hand, and real and immediate, on the other, shape one
                    another. If the imprinting of the earlier affective relationship mediates inti-
                    mate ties in the present or future, the ability to read that effect depends on
                    this back-and-forthness that the analysis encourages.
                            Seriality as a form of reading provides some distinct shape and mar-
                    gins to narrative events, to reading installments by comparing with the
                    past narrative chunk, or a growing awareness of the ongoingness of serial-
                    ity. Eliot’s narrators, especially in her earlier fiction like the serialized

              Scenes of Clerical Life and in the unserialized Adam Bede and The Mill on the
              Floss, encourage this transferential reading pattern.7 Take this reflexive
              moment from the second segment of “Amos Barton” published in
              Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine in February 1857: “As it is, you can, if
              you please, decline to pursue my story farther; and you will easily find
              reading more to your taste, since I learn from newspapers that many
              remarkable novels, full of striking situations, thrilling incidents, and elo-
              quent writing have appeared only within the last season.”8 Eliot lines up
              the series of worlds here, “my story” and “reading more to your taste” that
              appears in the daily pages of other publications, and the emotional
              promise of those earlier “thrilling incidents” or “striking situations”
              might cast a stronger force on the present ordinary realism. That reading
              is a transferential seriality is crucial to understanding Eliot’s realism, with
              the reflexive narrator managing the pivots between story and extra-story
              worlds. This seriality of transference also structures Charles Dickens’s
              double-narrated part-issue serial Bleak House, where the third-person nar-
              rator declares at the start of the final chapter of the second installment:
              “While Esther sleeps, and while Esther wakes, it is still wet weather down
              at the place in Lincolnshire.”9 This narrator functions like a looming con-
              sciousness outside Esther and gestures to a realm that exists whether she
              is unconscious or awake, and yet this narrating voice complements the
              story Esther tells. Like a series of narrating personas, transference struc-
              tures affective ties and ways of apprehending those links.
                      Taking seriality and transference in a different direction, I also pro-
              pose that subjectivity and character formation operate in a similar way.
              For example, Wuthering Heights offers the serial subject of the female bil-
              dungsroman, where the first volume centers on the elder Catherine
              Earnshaw Linton’s story and the second volume on her daughter
              Catherine Linton Earnshaw. The seriality of these two characters is essen-
              tial for Brontë’s apprehension of what it means to move from girlhood
              to womanhood where the parts are still separate entities—in this case, char-
              acters—of female subjectivity. A different spin on serial subjectivity involves
              two novels, both serialized, where one character recycles aspects of an ear-
              lier character. How might, say, Lydia Gwilt in Armadale (serialized in The
              Cornhill Nov. 1864—June 1866) afford a transferential subject for Lydia
              Glasher in Daniel Deronda (serialized monthly in eight parts from
              February to September 1876)? How do we structure our successive readings
              of characters through a kind of transferential attachment of meanings?
              John Harmon in Our Mutual Friend offers another instance of serial subjec-
              tivity also as a plot mechanism. Seriality is a flexible concept, I want to

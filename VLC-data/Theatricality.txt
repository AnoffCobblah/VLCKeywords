              Theatricality
              SHARON ARONOFSKY WELTMAN
              D       URING its first season, the hit television series Glee aired an episode
                       named “Theatricality,” in which the talented glee club kids pay
              homage to Lady Gaga and Kiss.1 They wear homemade versions of the
              stars’ hyperextravagant costumes in their high school’s hallways as well
              as on stage, using their wild (and wildly creative) outfits for defiant self-
              expression, braving harsh reactions from bullies and the school principal.
              Beyond the students’ personal flair, the title draws attention to the epi-
              sode as exuberant performance rather than as a mimetic approximation
              of real life.
                      Because “theatricality” denotes knowingness about the medium’s
              effect, it is also defined negatively: “the quality of being exaggerated
              and excessively dramatic.”2 This is how Thomas Carlyle uses the term
              in its oldest recorded instance (which is Victorian): The French
              Revolution (1837) opposes theatricality to sincerity.3 Here Carlyle displays
              the antitheatricality that Jonas Barish chronicles in The Anti-theatrical

                    Prejudice (1981),4 which details cultural bias against theater and anything
                    theatrical from Plato to the present. But the Victorians were not mono-
                    lithically antitheatrical. Lynn Voskuil states that they “developed a sophis-
                    ticated capacity . . . to act authentically and be theatrical at the same
                    time.”5 This centuries-long tension between celebrating and snubbing
                    theatricality becomes even more complicated as the word has taken on
                    a variety of meanings among theater historians and literary critics.
                            Tracy Davis and Thomas Postlewait explain that theatricality is both a
                    “practice” and a “theoretical concept,” on the one hand “characterized
                    by histrionic actions, manners and devices” and on the other “an inter-
                    pretive model for describing psychological identity, social ceremonies,
                    communal festivities, and public spectacles.”6 Erika Fischer-Lichte
                    defines the word through semiotics: because every actor can be replaced
                    by another actor in the same role, actors are themselves signs represent-
                    ing other cultural signs outside the performance.7 Janelle Reinelt traces
                    the shifting definitions of “theatricality” in dialectical conjunction with
                    the equally fluid meanings of “performativity”; while performativity requires
                    bodies physically engaged in time-bound actions, theatricality points to
                    “texts or performances that gesture to their own conditions of production
                    or to metatheatrical effects.”8As Beth Palmer proclaims, both “perfor-
                    mance and theatricality have become key terms for scholars working across
                    wide reaches of Victorian studies.”9 Deborah Vlock examines the Victorian
                    novel as a genre that is intertwined with the theater both through per-
                    formed readings and through language borrowed from the theater within
                    the novels themselves.10 I use “theatricality” both to designate textual invo-
                    cations of theater and performance in prose as Vlock describes, particularly
                    those moments ripe for embodied performance in adaptation, and—in
                    the way Glee’s episode title suggests—to indicate a heightened (and often
                    pleasurable) awareness of the artifice of performance of any kind.11
                            By “artifice,” I do not mean antirealism: on stage or in fiction, real-
                    ism involves just as much artifice as theatricality.12 Theatricality appears
                    not only in live performance but also in prose. By examining novels,
                    Joseph Litvak details the “subtle diffusion” of theater through Victorian
                    culture, “the normalization of theatricality.”13 He points to the amateur
                    theatricals within Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park (1814), in which the char-
                    acters enact Elizabeth Inchbald’s Lovers’ Vows (1798), advancing the plot
                    and providing a mechanism for revealing the immorality of some charac-
                    ters. At other times, a narrated scene is theatrical because characters con-
                    sciously perform for spectators, even outside a formally structured
                    theatrical context. For example, in Charles Dickens’s Oliver Twist

              (1837–9), the boys comically play at picking Fagin’s pockets while Oliver
              watches and laughs.14 The theatricality of this scene—just a descriptive
              paragraph in the novel, without dialogue—manifests itself in perfor-
              mance in every significant adaptation since George Almar’s in 1838.15
                      Such theatricality in Oliver Twist is part of its explicit melodramatic
              aesthetic. Dickens famously reasons in Chapter 17 that his novel is coun-
              terintuitively all the more realistic for being like a melodrama (the nine-
              teenth century’s most popular dramatic form): we do not register the
              melodrama of real life, he declares, because we are the “busy actors
              instead of passive lookers-on.”16 In addition to Dickens’s seizing a theat-
              rical genre to structure this particular novel, his writing practice in gene-
              ral emanated from performance: Mamie Dickens recounted her father’s
              acting in front of a mirror as he wrote, cracking up and jotting down
              whatever came next.17 David Kurnick argues that for certain Victorian
              novelists, such as Henry James and George Eliot, “theater is a condition
              of the text”; had they not once been immersed in theatrical writing and
              experience, they would never have written fiction.18 I argue that for some
              Victorian novelists—and Dickens is an excellent example—not only the-
              ater but also musical theater is a necessary condition of the text. Dickens’s
              full passage about melodrama quoted above from Oliver Twist cites alter-
              nating scenes like “streaky bacon” not only of pathos and humor but also
              of song, culminating in “the great hall of the castle, where a grey-headed
              seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals.”19 It is
              important to remember that when Dickens (or any author) writes in
              the melodramatic mode, he writes within the context of musical theater,
              since Victorian melodramas were always performed with live music, both
              songs and underscoring. The most theatrical moments in the novel are
              also often the most musically theatrical. In this light, it should be no sur-
              prise that a common synonym of “theatrical” is “melodramatic.”
                      Like many Victorian authors, Dickens writes scenes that are richly
              musical theatrical. The Mystery of Edwin Drood burgeons with them, as
              when the villain Jasper plays the organ or when Mr. Crisparkle sings
              “Tell me, Shepherds,”20 a song repeatedly identified in nineteenth-
              century musical literature as a glee.21 Glee clubs began near London
              with Harrow’s Glee Club (1787–1857), proliferating internationally and
              flourishing throughout the nineteenth century.22 Glee not only picks up
              on this still widespread and largely Victorian phenomenon, but also by
              alternating comedy, pathos, and song, each episode inherits much of
              its dramatic structure from Victorian melodrama. Given Glee’s Victorian

              Transatlanticism
              LINDA K. HUGHES
              F     IRST a few words about the collaborative contemplation of this key-
                    word. It emerges most directly from the fact that all five of us are cur-
              rently engaged in editing Transatlantic Anglophone Literatures, 1776–1920,
              scheduled for publication by Edinburgh University Press in 2020. Three
              of us are Americanists, two of us British studies specialists. But I suggest
              that collaboration is not merely a pragmatic result of our working as an
              editorial team; it is intrinsic to transatlanticism itself, a metaprocess, so to
              speak, answering to the interactive intellectual, material, social, and
              cultural forces that bring transatlanticism into being.
                      Transatlanticism extends back in deep time further than we can see,
              to any humans who traveled across the Atlantic in any direction, by any
              means, and touched on shores on the other side.1 But if Victorian-era
              transatlanticism emerged from prior global passages, it underwent, to
              pun deliberately, a sea change in the nineteenth century. Altered
              national relations resulting from revolutions (American, French,
              Haitian), wars, imperial ambitions, economic development and exploita-
              tion on one hand, or reform movements (abolition, expanding citizen
              rights and aspirations) on the other, quickened interchanges between
              nations around the Atlantic basin. New ideas—themselves “forms” in

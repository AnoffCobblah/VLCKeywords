              D       ROR Wahrman compares it to a layer cake. Paul Fussell has said it
                      resembles a bus: the structure remains the same, even as individual
              riders come and go. David Cannadine makes the point that, rather than
              do away with earlier systems of rank and inheritance, the tripartite dis-
              tinctions so commonly invoked—upper, middle, and lower—reinforce
              them.1 The school system in Victorian England was organized into
              three “grades,” and the same structure (often tripartite) appears
              throughout social and economic life today: in education, in air and
              train travel, and in consumer culture. Rather than destroy the old

                    hierarchy, writes Cannadine, the industrial revolution “created hierar-
                    chies of its own with which to reinforce it.”2 Indeed, the three-tiered sys-
                    tem has an aesthetic, orderly appeal, as if invented by some farsighted
                    and fetishistic architect: “In no other country is society thus beautifully
                    proportioned,” wrote Sarah Stickney Ellis admiringly of England’s lay-
                    ered confection of class.3
                            As a middle child, I learned early about the living of the hierarchical
                    life: a life in which a different position in the birth order (or, as the story
                    of Jacob and Esau calls it, “birthright”) could be desired even though, to bor-
                    row the bus analogy, one could never get off. Social inequality, as every sib-
                    ling knows, begins in the family, and as Jacob knew the distribution of status
                    was only another name for the distribution of love. Life in the middle means
                    looking both high and low while attempting to steer a safe middle course;
                    the term “parental child” serving as a sop, perhaps, to the child who strives
                    toward a never-open position, no matter how worthy the self-appraising aspi-
                    rant. Parental love is not (as Jacob also knew) equally distributed, though
                    the fiction, to paraphrase Dickens’s Mr. Bagnet, must be maintained.
                            It is a truism in Victorian studies of class to say that no one really
                    knows what the term means.4 This formulation sometimes indicates
                    that no one knows how many layers the cake has—a proposition often
                    followed by the proposal that it is more a mille-feuille than a triple-
                    decker, and that no one can name its many divisions because they are
                    so numerous and so finely cut. But it also means that people talk
                    about many different things when they talk about class—money, taste,
                    manners, speech—so that class “means” many different things and signi-
                    fies in different ways. The mille-feuille effect is reinforced by such
                    touches as Victorian middle-class women’s ever-so-subtle distinctions of
                    dress, in which “Every cap, bow, streamer, ruffle, fringe, bustle, glove
                    or other elaboration symbolized some status category for the female
                    wearer.”5 The same mystifying rules applied to etiquette, where, in a
                    drama more suggestive of a CIA plot than Victorian Studies, they were
                    always changing, the better to distinguish insiders from outsiders.
                            The phrase “no one knows what it means,” then—in the case of class
                    as in so many other areas of life—means only that an exact, perhaps sci-
                    entific definition remains elusive. A set of signs is always changing though
                    its purpose and essence remain the same, including some and excluding
                    others on the basis of an arbitrary assertion of value. Thus, it could make
                    sense to say, in the mode currently fashionable in Victorian Studies, that
                    what is incomprehensibly tied to manner or ruffle is completely under-
                    standable as feeling or affect. Ruffles and calling cards were transient

              signs of class position, but their emotional meaning remained constant: I
              am in and you are out; I know the secret and you do not; for me it is
              effortless, while for you it is work.
                      Esau, the older son in the Biblical story, sells his birthright to his
              brother Jacob in exchange for a dish of porridge. Later, their blind father
              Abraham, wishing to bestow a blessing on his first-born favorite, is tricked
              by the younger, who, with the help of his mother, covers himself in goat
              hides so that Abraham will think that he is touching Esau’s hairy skin. As
              a child, I had no idea why I returned obsessively to this story, and indeed
              have only now recalled my interest in it. Is it because it is a story about
              class, or about sibling rivalry, or both? Carolyn Steedman has written
              about the way children map social structures onto familial ones: the
              child, encountering class hierarchies in life, questions his own parents’
              status.6 But status, again, is a lesson first learned at home. From the mid-
              dle, the idea of moving up in the hierarchy is of compelling and guilty
              interest, the latter since it necessarily involves stealing what cannot be
              stolen: another’s birth, another’s “right.” The topic of class, then, brings
              to the fore the unstable mixture of displacement and desire, comfort and
              satisfaction that informs a position that is neither here nor there—a com-
              bination captured by A. A. Milne in lines that sit alongside my Jacob/
              Esau memories:

                    D        ATA was not a word that the Victorians used regularly. The British
                             English corpus of the Google NGram viewer, which visualizes word fre-
                    quency across the corpus of books scanned by Google as of 2012, shows a
                    slow increase in the use of the word “data” in the nineteenth century,
                    with a dramatic spike around 1990 (see fig. 1). The Oxford English
                    Dictionary ties the rise of “data” specifically to the rise of computing and com-
                    puters in the mid-twentieth century. Data is collective. Now typically used as
                    a mass noun, data signifies related bits of information, usually numbers, con-
                    sidered collectively. Informally, data means any sort of digital information.
                            In this essay, I use digital humanities methods to collect data about the
                    Victorian novel. Concentrating on Anthony Trollope’s third Chronicle of
                    Barsetshire, Doctor Thorne, I examine what social media traces on
                    Goodreads, a popular social cataloguing site where users review and recom-
                    mend books to friends, can tell us about the way we read Victorian litera-
                    ture now. In doing so, I hope to uncover information about a collective
                    everyday Victorianism. While previous work in reader response theory suf-
                    fered from the difficulty of obtaining data on how people read, for the first

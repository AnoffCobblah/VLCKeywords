                                                                                                                  SOUND             889
              John Picker has argued that “the development of Victorian self-awareness
              was contingent on awareness of sonic environments.”1 With the excep-
              tion of Picker’s Victorian Soundscapes, many recent studies of the way
              Victorian writers represented sound have focused on poetry, especially
              the work of Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Christina Rossetti. I would like
              to call attention to the way sound worked metaphorically in some
              nineteenth-century fiction: as an alternative to the classic Western meta-
              phor that represented knowledge through vision. Flannery O’Connor
              has pointed out that, “the nature of fiction is in large measure deter-
              mined by the nature of our perceptive apparatus . . . [and] the fiction
              writer begins where human perception begins.”2 Writers engage readers
              through the senses, and descriptions of sound suggest thoughts and emo-
              tions in ways that representations of vision cannot. Picker has observed
              that in Victorian prose, sound served “as a metaphor for the communica-
              tion of meaning.”3 Through a brief analysis of works by Edgar Allan Poe
              and Thomas Hardy, I would like to suggest that in the nineteenth cen-
              tury, descriptions of sound conveyed paths to truth that circumvented
              reason. Metaphorically, the perception of sounds could imply a growing
              awareness of truths too terrible to “see.”4
                      Poe organized the narrative of “The Fall of the House of Usher”
              (1839) around sound. His epigraph by Pierre-Jean de Béranger, “Son
              coeur est un luth suspendu; Sitôt qu’one [sic] touche il résonne” (“His
              heart is a suspended lute; as soon as one touches it, it resonates”) refers
              to Roderick Usher, who seems too sensitive to live.5 Physiologically,
              sound and touch are closely related, since when the cells of the inner
              ear vibrate, the world touches its listener. Poe’s tale is told by a school
              friend of Usher who has come to cheer him, and the story follows his
              slow discovery of just how disturbed Usher is. Usher’s “morbid acuteness
              of the senses” affects every modality, but Poe uses sound synecdochically
              to show Usher’s general hypersensitivity.6 Above all, Usher suffers from a
              “morbid condition of the auditory nerve.”7 This synecdoche serves Poe
              well, since it seems that one good tremor could disintegrate Usher’s
              fine tissue as it would the crumbling stones of his house. This tremor
              comes when Usher’s twin sister dies and the protagonist helps him
              place her in a vault. When the door’s “immense weight caused an unusu-
              ally sharp, grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges,” it speaks of the
              horrifying proximity of death.8
                      Like a composer, Poe uses intensifying sounds to drive his story
              toward its climax. In a suspenseful sequence, the protagonist begins to
              “hear” a disturbing truth that has been known to Usher for some time.

                    During a violent storm, he reads aloud to Usher and hears increasingly
                    real echoes of the fictional sounds. Usher confesses, “Yes, I hear it, and
                    have heard it. Long—long—long—many minutes, many hours, many
                    days, have I heard it—yet I dared not—oh, pity me, miserable wretch
                    that I am!—I dared not—I dared not speak! We have put her living in the
                    tomb!”9 Usher and his sister die together, and the protagonist flees
                    their collapsing house. The story ends when “a long tumultuous shouting
                    sound like the voice of a thousand waters” sinks into silence, and the ter-
                    rible truth settles.10 Through sound, Poe has tracked a slow, horrifying
                    awareness that couldn’t be rendered through sight.
                            In Tess of the d’Urbervilles (1891), Thomas Hardy also uses sound to
                    represent looming truths and encroaching forces. One could read
                    these forces as industrial, but they also take the form of social laws and
                    human cruelty. Hardy describes sound to place a reader in a scene, as
                    when “the milk in the revolving churn . . . changed its squashing for a
                    decided flick-flack.”11 Hardy’s sounds do more than engage readers, how-
                    ever; in context, they often do symbolic work for the story. Tess has been
                    shuddering at the tale of an unwed pregnant girl, and as Angel pursues
                    her, she fears her past will be discovered. She flees outside to hear “a sol-
                    itary cracked-voiced reed sparrow” singing “in a sad, machine-made
                    tone.”12 In this emotional moment, the bird’s mechanical music suggests
                    the soulless natural and social worlds that Tess perceives.
                            Repeatedly, Hardy has Tess awaken in darkness, with only sound to
                    alert her to the horrors around her. Her horse Prince is killed as she
                    sleeps, and she is startled awake by “a hollow groan, unlike anything
                    she had ever heard in her life.”13 “A slight creak” alerts her to the pres-
                    ence of sleep-walking Angel, and “strange sounds . . . sometimes . . . a
                    palpitation, sometimes a flutter; sometimes . . . a sort of gasp or gurgle”
                    betray the bloodied pheasants dying near her as she sleeps outdoors.14
                    Both Tess’s rapist, Alec, and her intolerant husband, Angel, can be
                    heard when they are not seen: Alec, through a “rustling of the branches;”
                    and Angel, through a “splashing.”15 Scenes in which characters can hear
                    but not see convey the terrifying predicament in which one senses dan-
                    ger but doesn’t know what or where it is.
                            Probably, Victorian writers used sound and vision differently as epis-
                    temological metaphors for cultural and physiological reasons. Long asso-
                    ciated with clarity and reason, vision carried baggage that made it
                    inadequate to represent the approach of an unknown, mechanized
                    modernity. If two of the nineteenth century’s most creative authors
                    depicted characters struggling to identify sounds in the dark, they may

                    Oceans
                    KELLY P. BUSHNELL
                         N these pages in 2015 Jesse Oak Taylor asked “Where is Victorian
                    I     Ecocriticism?,” remarking that the “striking thing about Victorian
                    ecocriticism is that there is so little of it.”1 Victorian ecocriticism, some-
                    times called “green studies,” has risen to the challenge with exciting
                    new titles such as Taylor’s own A Sky of Our Making: London Fog from
                    Coleridge to Woolf.2 However, Victorian ecocriticism—and literary and
                    eco-studies at large—has only just begun to expand its reach to the
                    sea. Steve Mentz writes that “Pining for the green solidarity of land, ecoc-
                    riticism has largely failed to develop models for encountering blue
                    oceans.”3 He calls for a “blue ecocriticism” or “blue cultural studies,” writ-
                    ing that “we need a poetic history of the oceans.”4 Victorianists are well
                    disposed to answer this call. The turn toward transnational and hemi-
                    spheric approaches to literary studies is especially well suited to a
                    “blue” Victorian ecocriticism, as the constellations of ports and maritime
                    shipping routes provide nodes along which so many of our narratives are
                    conducted. In a period in which Britannia so thoroughly “rules the
                    waves,” how does literature account for what might be lurking in those
                    waves and for the joys and terrors of life on—or near—the sea?
                            Of Romantic oceans, Samuel Baker has argued that the Lake Poets
                    “invented the idea of ‘culture’” in the early nineteenth century by “fram-
                    ing their picture of human life as a whole within the horizon of a com-
                    mon experience of the sea,”5 and new monographs and collections are
                    finally accounting for their Victorian heirs. Andrew Nash has recently
                    published on the long-neglected Victorian nautical novelist William
                    Clark Russell; Steve Mentz and Martha Elena Rojas’s collection The Sea
                    and Nineteenth-Century Anglophone Literary Culture includes an impressive
                    range of perspectives; and Charlotte Mathieson’s edited collection Sea
                    Narratives: Cultural Responses to the Sea, 1600–present reflects on the rela-
                    tionship between the sea and literary production.6 Other exciting work
                    is forthcoming, such as Matthew Kerr’s Boundless: The Language of the
                    Sea in the Nineteenth-Century Novel, which argues that the “vagueness of
                    sea writing offers a useful paradigm for thinking about literary language
                    itself.”7 “Blue” Victorian ecocriticism will also feature in Will Abberley’s
                    forthcoming collection Underwater Worlds: Aquatic Visions in Art and
                    Literature, based on the conference of the same name at the Oxford
                    Research Centre for the Humanities (TORCH) in 2015.

                      A “chronotope” (to use Margaret Cohen’s formulation8) of the sea
              that is crucial to Victorian studies is the shore. For an island nation with
              11,073 miles of coastline (according to the Ordnance Survey), human
              interaction in this interstitial space of land and sea is fraught with con-
              flict. Amy M. King ignited my own interest in the tide pool as literary
              microcosm in her essay “Reorienting the Scientific Frontier: Victorian
              Tide Pools and Literary Realism” in 2005.9 Of tide pool creatures,
              Jonathan Smith’s Charles Darwin and Victorian Visual Cultures argues that
              Darwin’s visual observations challenged John Ruskin’s ideal aesthetics,
              and of particular note to the blue humanities are his considerations of
              “The Scientific and Cultural Life of Darwin’s Barnacles,” which engages
              depictions of the seaside in the mid-nineteenth century.10 Ursula
              Kluwick and Virginia Richter have recently edited The Beach in
              Anglophone Literatures and Cultures: Reading Littoral Space, which includes
              an excellent introduction theorizing this contact zone, and Brad
              Beaven, Karl Bell, and Robert James’s 2016 collection Port Towns and
              Urban Cultures: International Histories of the Waterfront contains multiple
              essays devoted to Victorian coastal industry (as opposed to the recrea-
              tional or scientific seaside).11
                      Drawing on the seminal work of Harriet Ritvo and Ann C. Colley, the
              “animal turn” in Victorian studies has shown that nonhuman animals
              abound and have considerable agency in the literature of this period.
              This “turn” has not, however, fully extended to the creatures of sea,
              though sea animals (as well as terrestrial animals thrust into maritime
              spaces) occupy an especially unstable narrative space. Of sea creatures,
              Deborah Denenholz Morse and Martin Danahay’s collection Victorian
              Animal Dreams includes Anca Vlasopoulos’s “Pacific Harvests: Whales
              and Albatrosses in Nineteenth-Century Markets,”12 while Richard
              Maxwell has looked at Tennyson’s Kraken and Genie Babb has consid-
              ered giant squid in H. G. Wells’ early work.13 These studies are gaining
              momentum, as my essay “Looking at Leviathan: The First Captive
              Cetaceans in Britain” is forthcoming in Maura Coughlin and Emily
              Gephart’s collection Nineteenth-Century Ecocritical Visual Cultures, and in
              April 2019 the University of Kent Animal Humanities Network will host
              a conference on “Maritime Animals: Telling Stories of Animals at Sea”
              at the National Maritime Museum.
                      In 2016, I completed the first edition of the “Maritime Literature”
              entry in the new online Oxford Bibliography of Victorian Literature.14 The
              bibliography contains over one hundred annotated sources and over-
              views and will be updated yearly to reflect new directions in the field. I

                    was pleased that the editors (at Oxford and now at VLC) recognize the
                    importance of maritime literature in our period, signaling a new commit-
                    ment to looking critically at the sea in this period, and I look forward to
                    seeing this exciting new direction in our field develop.15 As the Times
                    remarked of a captive whale at the Westminster Aquarium in 1878,
                    “There is nothing so fascinating to an English crowd as a sea monster.”16
                    Taking that as our rallying cry toward a poetic history of the ocean, let us
                    attend to the Victorian sea and its many monsters—those who swim and
                    those who walk on two legs.

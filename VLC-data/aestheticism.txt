              explanation, seldom adverted to the word. Usually thought of (at best) as
              a set of principles that upholds art for art’s sake or (at worst) a voguish
              movement that the flamboyant young Oscar Wilde iconized, aestheticism
              has begun to flourish as a resonant keyword that readily identifies recog-
              nizable phenomena. A quick look at the spate of recent scholarly articles,
              essay collections, and academic monographs that address aestheticism
              indicates that it is inspiring not only innovative studies that embrace
              the ageing Pre-Raphaelites, Walter Pater and his queer adherents, and
              fin-de-siècle poets with a penchant for formes fixes; its guiding ideas
              have also assisted in shaping current analyses of such spectacles as
              modern horror (the vivid title of Geoff Klock’s 2017 book summons
              the term’s remarkable potency: Aestheticism, Evil, Homosexuality, and
              Hannibal: If Oscar Wilde Ate People). At the same time, philosophers
              have demonstrated some interest in styles of neo-aestheticism: an intellec-
              tual turn that in part constitutes a reaction against Terry Eagleton’s dia-
              tribe, Ideology of the Aesthetic (1990). Eagleton’s Marxist hostility had the
              virtue of spurring Isobel Armstrong in her tour de force, The Radical
              Aesthetic (2000), to redefine the false consciousness that he identified
              with l’art pour l’art. Prior to Eagleton’s assault, the resources for taking
              seriously the emergence of a movement that relished—in Pater’s words
              from 1868—“the love of art for art’s sake” were somewhat dispersed,1
              with the most heavyweight studies of British éstheticisme appearing (as
              the spelling attests) from two distinguished scholars, Albert J. Farmer
              and Louise Rosenblatt, who published in French.2
                      As a keyword, aestheticism characterizes the apparent preoccupation
              that groups of late Victorians (roughly from the 1870–1900 era) had with
              the necessity and urgency of celebrating beauty in the face of ugly and
              violent modernity. And given that such prominent aesthetes as Vernon
              Lee wrote studies with titles like The Beautiful: An Introduction to
              Psychological Aesthetics (1913), aestheticism appears to enjoy a certain
              field-defining coherence, one that enables literary historians to explore
              friendship groups among art-lovers, developments in fine presses,
              and—especially in the cases of Pater and Wilde—thoughtful engage-
              ments with the legacy of German Romanticism (notably Schiller and
              Hegel) about form, reason, and sense as well as (in relation to Lee)
              more recent advances in thinking about Einfühlung or empathy.
                      But there is, needless to say, a different history of aestheticism that
              does not quite live up to the ways in which scholars invoke the term in
              their current inquiries. If we refer to the 1884 first edition of the OED,
              it tells us that the earliest literary usage of aestheticism occurs in the

                    Cambridge scholar George Brimley’s not terribly complimentary discus-
                    sion of Tennyson’s otherwise well-received two-volume collection Poems
                    (1842). Brimley’s lengthy essay, which dates from 1855, dwells for some
                    time on Tennyson’s “The Lotos-Eaters” (1832, revised 1842), which
                    Brimley clearly finds morally objectionable. His main complaint is that
                    this work “carries Tennyson’s tendency to pure æstheticism to an
                    extreme point.”3 “It is picture and music,” he declares, “and nothing
                    more.”4 Brimley cannot tolerate the luscious atmosphere that the
                    poem conjures for the mental and physical discombobulation of the mar-
                    iners who, in Book 9 of Homer’s Odyssey, are washed up on an island
                    where the inhabitants ingest a fruit that has all the qualities of an opiate:
                             A land of streams! some, like a downward smoke,
                             Slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn, did go;
                             And some thro’ wavering lights and shadows broke,
                             Rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below.5
                    Very soon, native peoples emerge from this perplexing but haunting
                    topography:
                             Branches they bore of that enchanted stem,
                             Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave
                             To each.6
                    Once the seamen partake of the fruit, they cannot tell whether they are
                    awaking or in some kind of reverie. At the same time, they hear their
                    heartbeats pounding like music in their ears. Their bodies, it seems,
                    have become living instruments subject to some larger, undefinable
                    force. There is nothing in the “Choric Song,” which Tennyson strategi-
                    cally revised in the 1842 text in order to combat the kind of critique
                    that Brimley mounted, that tempers the disagreeable aestheticism of
                    the poem. Even though the voyagers strike a note of troubling irony
                    when they speak in unison of the newfound pleasures of permanent seda-
                    tion (“slumber is more sweet than toil,”7 they say), it remains the case for
                    Brimley that the poem belongs to a suspect corpus that reveals a poet
                    who “is trying to live by the outward things about him, and by the enjoy-
                    ment they afford to his intellect,” rather than attend “to God and his
                    fellow-beings” as well as his “spiritual life.”8 In every way, aestheticism
                    exudes a negative quality.
                            As one searches for further Victorian recurrences of the term, we
                    learn that aestheticism—as the OED also reminds us—enjoyed a broader

              range of reference than to an unwarranted literary indulgence in sensu-
              ousness. Still, on each of these rather different occasions the word also
              assumes a pejorative tone. The term designated, for example, a deviation
              from Anglican doctrine when the controversies surrounding Ritualism in
              High Church practices troubled ecclesiastics across England. In 1867, just
              to take one instance, the Bath Chronicle reported on the Bishop of
              Gloucester and Bristol’s second visitation to Gloucester Cathedral
              where he addressed a group of sixty churchmen. When it came to coun-
              tenancing the elements of Catholic ritual that had crept into some
              Church of England services, the bishop began by conceding that those
              priests who had originally imported such practices—such as employing
              a thurible for the diffusion of incense or ringing bells during the eleva-
              tion of the Eucharistic host—may have done so in good faith. Now, how-
              ever, it was clearly the case that such ritualistic excesses had gone too far.
              “Innocent æstheticism,” the writer remarked, “or simple and unmixed
              desire to do honour to the nearer coming Lord, had now merged into
              what was far, far different, and had become absorbed by desires and feel-
              ings that were at variance with the principles of the Reformation, and
              were incompatible with an honest recognition of the national church.”9
              Here Catholic ritual is both implicitly sensory, creating sensations that
              confound doctrinal judgment, and equally treacherous, making the
              nation liable to a wholesale return to Rome.
                      Such information suggests why, in the very the period that it is supposed
              to delineate, aestheticism had few sponsors. The word does not appear in
              Pater’s writings. Nor does it make its presence known in any of Wilde’s pub-
              lished works. Yet it was Wilde who was arguably the first to transvalue the
              much-abused term not long after he arrived in New York City, where he
              began a year-long lecture tour that aimed to spread the word about art for
              art’s sake across the Continent. No sooner had he informed the journalists
              who were crowding the docks to greet him that the Atlantic had been a
              great disappointment than he gave an interview to the New York World,
              which wanted him to define the term that they thought identified his intel-
              lectual standpoint. “You spoke just now of aestheticism as a philosophy,” an
              intrigued reporter stated to Wilde. “Is that your classification of the sci-
              ence?”10 “Assuredly,” Wilde confirmed. “It is a study of what may be found
              in art and in nature. It is a pursuit of the secret of life. Whatever in art repre-
              sents eternal truth expresses the great underlying truth of aestheticism.”11
              This is, I believe, the first occasion when a literary figure sought to character-
              ize aestheticism as an ideal. But in the rather sporadic life-cycle that the term
              underwent from the 1870s to the time of Victoria’s death, aestheticism never

                    transformed into a developed theory, even in Wilde’s finest pieces of criti-
                    cism. By 1895, when Max Beerbohm looked back on the young Wilde’s
                    debut as an “ultra-aesthetic[al]” young man in “1880,” the term conjured
                    “purely aesthetic fads,” such as the outdoor plays that Lady Archibald
                    Campbell hosted in the grounds of her estate at Coombe Wood: “It was
                    the very Derby day of Æstheticism.”12 In the face of such good-humored triv-
                    ializing, this keyword remained for decades in a state of definitional suspen-
                    sion before whatever it truly was—or really could or should have been—
                    became self-evident in modern literary history.

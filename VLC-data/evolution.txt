              Evolution
              KATHLEEN FREDERICKSON
                      HARLES Darwin famously does not use the word “evolution” in the
              C       first edition of On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or
              the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life (1859). Only with the
              sixth edition of 1872 does Origin mention the word. Reflecting on evolu-
              tion’s altered status as a legitimate scientific principle, Darwin writes that
              “things are wholly changed, and almost every naturalist admits the great
              principle of evolution.”1 As a younger man, he had seen both naturalist
              and non-naturalist friends be skeptical, dismissive, or wary of earlier evo-
              lutionary hypotheses; by 1872, among naturalists at least, natural selec-
              tion might be contentious, but evolution itself was not.

                            The use of the word “evolution” as a term for what was also known as
                    the transmutation of species was of comparatively recent vintage. First
                    appearing in French in 1831, the usage migrated into English the follow-
                    ing year in Charles Lyell’s influential Principles of Geology. Lyell uses the
                    word “evolution” to describe the ideas of the French naturalist
                    Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who was, by then, well known as a proponent of
                    the view that species transmute as a result of adaptation and the inheri-
                    tance of acquired characteristics;2 for Lyell, Lamarckian “evolution”
                    evoked a procedural uniformity and temporal gradualism that he prized
                    in his own analysis of geological processes. Lamarck, though, was not the
                    sole progenitor of such views. Notable among Lamarck’s predecessors in
                    the transmutation hypothesis was Darwin’s grandfather Erasmus Darwin,
                    a figure who was simultaneously, as Devin Griffiths insists, a “crank” and
                    “the most important British advocate of evolution” in the pre-Origin
                    years.3 Though there is no evidence that Lamarck encountered it,
                    Erasmus Darwin’s 1794 Zoonomia anticipated many of Lamarck’s claims,
                    especially with respect to how the use and disuse of organs might factor
                    in species change.
                            Erasmus Darwin, Lamarck, and Lyell all provided the backdrop for
                    Darwin’s private musings on speciation in the so-called transmutation note-
                    books of the late 1830s. When he began writing these notebooks in 1837,
                    Darwin had read Zoonomia at home as a teenager, Lamarck’s Systême des
                    Animaux sans Vertèbres as a hapless medical student in Edinburgh, and
                    Lyell’s Principles (as well as Lamarck’s Philosophie Zoölogique) aboard the
                    HMS Beagle on its now famous 1831–36 voyage. Darwin would later also
                    grapple with the contentious reception of Robert Chambers’s wildly popu-
                    lar 1844 Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. Darwin found Vestiges to be
                    facile and unscientific, but the many and sometimes hostile reviews of it also
                    inflected his thinking about whether to announce his views on the species
                    question. Only the fear of being scooped on the theory of natural selection
                    spurred Darwin to overcome his trepidation. Darwin completed Origin
                    hastily after Alfred Russel Wallace sent Darwin his paper “On the
                    Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely from the Original Type” in
                    1858. In this paper, Wallace articulates his own (independent) conclusion
                    that species evolve through a tendency to variation “by minute steps, in var-
                    ious directions,” with varieties that exhibit “slightly increased powers of pre-
                    serving existence” persisting in the face of a Malthusian struggle for life.4
                            Many contemporary readers are used to thinking about Darwinian
                    natural selection as coterminous with evolution, even though, as the

              thought has been non-Darwinian in character.”5 Some of evolution’s
              best-known popularizers were as indebted to Lamarck as to Darwin.
              Herbert Spencer—the coiner of the influential phrase “the survival of
              the fittest”6—is representative of many nineteenth-century appropria-
              tions of evolution: though Spencer was happy to adopt natural selection
              into his notorious advocacy of a brutal laissez-faire economic philosophy,
              he retains key Lamarckian principles around adaptation and inheri-
              tance.7 Similarly, with very different political commitments, the anarchist
              and Russian émigré Peter (Pyotr) Kropotkin likewise defends elements of
              Lamarckian theory, though he draws most heavily on Darwin in his
              description of evolutionary cooperation and “mutual aid.”
                      This is not, though, to suggest that Darwinian natural and sexual
              selection does not shape the sociobiological imaginary of the nineteenth
              century. This influence becomes especially pronounced after the 1871
              publication of The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex. Gillian
              Beer’s now classic account of the uses of evolution as a narrative para-
              digm stresses that Darwin’s later writing on sexual selection turned to
              “the individual or communal will” as a “shaping influence.”8 This empha-
              sis on sexual selection as a basis for social policy seemed to license the
              eugenic theories put forward by his cousin Francis Galton—theories
              that Darwin himself found compelling.9 From the late nineteenth
              century onwards, Darwin’s work becomes frequently invoked in a white
              supremacism under which, as Sylvia Wynter writes, “all the people of
              Black Africa” appear as “an undeserving race because dysselected-by-
              Evolution within the logic of the Darwinian paradigm.”10
                      But though scholars debate how and when Darwin’s thought
              becomes drawn into eugenic thinking and scientific racism, the associa-
              tion between them is neither wholly determined, nor entirely inciden-
              tal.11 Both Nihad Farooq and Cannon Schmitt write about Darwin’s
              time aboard the Beagle with respect to, in Farooq’s words, his “alternat-
              ingly relativistic and imperial manner of looking at the natural
              world.”12 Without discounting, for instance, Darwin’s blithe comments
              about genocide in the Descent of Man, or the appropriation of the theory
              of natural selection for eugenic racism, recent scholarship also seeks to
              emphasize the uses that anticapitalist, feminist, and anticolonial thinkers
              have been able to draw from evolutionary thought. Marwa Elshakry
              argues that, after a first wave of more individualist glosses, Arab intellec-
              tuals developed theories of evolutionary socialism at the turn of the twen-
              tieth century that included a “growing international critique of Western
              capitalist and imperial expansion outside of Europe.”13 For a number of

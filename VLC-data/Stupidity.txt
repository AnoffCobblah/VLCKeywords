                    W          HAT if stupidity were a category not so much of intellect as of feel-
                               ing? Do we not, by and large, feel stupid, even when we are not? From
                    the Latin stupidus or stupe¯re, to be stupid means to be stunned or
                    benumbed, as in stupefied by surprise or grief. Such stupidity is embodied,
                    felt. It is not primarily (if at all) a deficit of I.Q. (an association that hard-
                    ened into being only with the eugenics movement). Like the concept of
                    genius, stupidity is a term “possessing rather more evaluative purpose
                    than precise semantic content”; like genius, it refers “to both character
                    and aptitude” while remaining both “hugely overdetermined [and]
                    strangely underspecified in its actual applications.”2 It is everywhere, yet
                    we cannot precisely define it. Still we know it when we see it or, I want
                    to insist, when we feel it—in the way consciousness itself can be felt.3
                            Calling stupidity a “quasi concept,” Avital Ronell notes that for the
                    Greeks stupidity “cannot be seen as belonging to the domain of the polit-
                    ical because it indicates that which lacks politics: it is being-
                    outside-the-political.”4 She’s referring to the <U+1F30>d<U+03B9><U+03CE>t<U+03B7><U+03C2> or idio¯ te¯s, the one
                    who, lacking professional skill, is exempt from public (political) life. He
                    isn’t doltish but private; he is ordinary. The Christian type is different,
                    because redemptive. It is by seeing my stupidity and repenting, Ronell
                    writes, that “I begin to become politically responsible.”5 In neither formu-
                    lation is stupidity evidence of lacking intelligence, much less congenital
                    mental impairment or an unchangeable attribute of self. Indeed stupidity
                    and idiocy are not the same. As Ronell reminds us, by way of Aristotle and
                    Northrup Frye, it is in the nature of the agroikos—the gull or rustic, the per-
                    manent child or idiot boy—to be, “precisely, not astonished.”6 What he is is
                    oblivious: not stupefied or stunned. Ronell refers to this state of idiocy as
                    “something like stupidity”—“stubborn and ignorant,” humorless, “insensi-
                    ble,” from the Greek anaisthe¯tos—but I would distinguish such anesthetized
                    unknowing from the stupidity I mean.7 He who is trapped in a state of per-
                    petual infancy cannot be stupid in the sense of being shocked by his own
                    self-difference with the world or his conceptions of it. He cannot be stupid
                    in the way Schlegel describes as “conscious,” for he senses not that he might
                    be otherwise than he is.
                            The historian François Hartog describes the peasant Strepsiades, in
                    Aristophanes’s The Clouds, this way: as “ignorant, Barbarian, clumsy, awk-
                    ward, slow, incapable of remembering anything, old-fashioned, more
                    archaic than Cronos or the moon.”8 Strepsiades is old, even prehistoric,
                    but he is also old-fashioned, gauche, inarticulate not like an animal but
                    like someone with a “noisy (unconscious) ignorance of good manners: of
                    how to dress, when to be surprised, when not to be surprised, etc.”9 A

              wealthy man now horribly in debt, bankrupt in all the ways one can be, but
              also physically brawny, excellent at masturbation and at complaining about
              the laziness of his slaves, Strepsiades appeals to Socrates for help in learning
              how to “debate” or “to speak.”10 Calling his a “demagogic rhetoric,” Daphne
              O’Regan describes Strepsiades as “literally minded.”11 Socrates “may imag-
              ine lofty disputation,” but for Strepsiades “logos is to be the force that will
              make him more availing in the verbal battles here on earth”: smallminded
              as well as violent, “his little notions will prevail over much more weighty argu-
              ments.”12 If this reminds you of another political demagogue, frivolous yet
              malign, closer to home: you are not alone.
                      It may be difficult to accept the claim, then, that this is just the sort
              of person who cannot be stupid in the sense that I mean. And yet this is
              what I want to argue: that, unlike the agroikos or tyrant, the stupid person
              is one who is capable of being stunned. It is in the nineteenth century that
              this new conception of stupidity most forcefully emerges.
                      The difference between Jane Austen’s stupidity and that of George
              Eliot is illustrative in this regard. Retaining but modifying the
              Strepsiades type, Austenian stupidity usually registers as a species of vul-
              garity wherein poor taste and insensibility go hand in hand. This is how
              you know a thing is stupid in Austen: it either bores or bugs. In Pride and
              Prejudice (1813), where the word “stupid” is used nine times, it can be a
              fixed quality of mind and person, and therefore pernicious. Toadying
              Mr. Collins offends precisely in his unconsciousness of the disgust he pro-
              duces in others. Strepsiades-lite, the sort of oaf whose tin ear and little
              mind murder pleasure, he is born with it—a “stupidity with which he
              was favored by nature”—and it isn’t going away.13 But stupidity can just
              as often indicate mere charmlessness. In Sense and Sensibility (1811),
              rain is “stupid”14; in Pride and Prejudice a table is “superlatively stupid”
              when dull people sit around it playing dully at cards.15 Such stupidity
              isn’t fixed but situational, an aspect of time and place. To be stupid is
              to score low on the scale of charisma, as do those officers of
              the Meryton regiment who are fine in their way, until judged against
              the affable Wickham, and then “were become stupid, disagreeable
              fellows.”16 Stupidity here is not an aspect of identity but something
              one can “become.” Or become less of. He who is stupid in times of
              flush may grow less so in gray February in a village thirty miles from
              town.
                      Stupidity in Eliot is more tragic and more common: a thing that is by
              everyone felt.17 Unlike Casaubon, unlike Bulstrode, unlike even the
              supreme egoist Rosamond Vincy, Austen’s Mr. Collins has no shrinking

                    sense that his friends merely tolerate him, that his wife chooses a smaller
                    chamber for meeting friends because there is less space for him in it.
                    He’s not embarrassed by the situation, even the room he’s in, and so
                    we might be tempted to say he is the stupider man. But that isn’t so,
                    because what Austen means by stupidity isn’t what Eliot describes. In
                    Eliot, consciousness always comes.

              Sustainability
              DEANNA K. KREISEL
              “S        USTAINABILITY ” generally means the ability to be maintained at
                         a certain level, but in recent years the word has come to refer
              almost exclusively to environmental sustainability: the perhaps fantastical
              set of circumstances under which life may continue on this planet under
              conditions similar to those prevailing now.1 While the word “sustainable”
              was not used in the contemporary sense of minimizing environmental
              impact until 1976,2 the concept has a much older history: historians of
              northern Europe, particularly Germany, have traced the development
              of sustainable forestry management and other agricultural practices
              back to the middle ages.3 But the concept (or perhaps we should say
              anxiety) really got a kick-start with the publication of the Reverend
              Thomas Malthus’s Essay on the Principle of Population in 1798.4 The argu-
              ment of that work was simply that population increases geometrically
              while food supply increases arithmetically; the two upward curves meet
              at a crisis point where famine becomes inevitable and population growth
              will thus be “checked.”5 The enormous cultural impact of Malthus’s the-
              sis is one good reason to date the birth of the modern sustainability idea
              to the nineteenth century. Others include the sharp increase in environ-
              mental stressors—in terms of pressure on both resources and environ-
              mental sinks—occasioned by the industrial revolution, and the birth of
              political economy as a professional discipline in the early decades of
              the century.6
                      For sustainability is essentially an economic question. Its two central
              components are issues with which political economists have long grap-
              pled: population and resources, including food. (Two other important
              components of sustainability could be mentioned: the management of
              waste, including carbon sinks, and climate change. Waste recycling was
              an important topic in the nineteenth century, but it was almost always
              invoked in the context of soil fertilization.7 And while Jesse Oak Taylor

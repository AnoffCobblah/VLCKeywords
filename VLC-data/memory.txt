              Memory
              JUDITH STODDART
              I   N 1869 John Stuart Mill published a new edition of his father’s Analysis
                   of the Phenomena of the Human Mind (1829), with a critical apparatus
              intended to update this foundational associationist psychology by refer-
              ence to more recent discoveries in mental science. But the apparatus’s
              explanatory power breaks down in the chapter on memory. As the elder
              Mill wraps up his demonstration that memory is a form of association,

                    where “sensation B, combined with the idea of self, calls up the idea of sen-
                    sation A combined with the idea of self,” John Stuart inserts a footnote.
                    What he adds to this process is not a scientific update, however, but a
                    leap of faith: to remember was to combine an association with a “belief
                    that the corresponding sensation was actually felt by me.”1 And here mental
                    science was caught in a conundrum: that belief was both generative of
                    memory and its product. The conviction that self A and B are connected
                    marks the association as memory; and yet, as he comments elsewhere, “I
                    see no reason to think that there is any cognizance of an Ego until memory
                    commences.”2 Thus “explaining memory by Self,” as his father’s associa-
                    tionism would have it, “seems very like explaining a thing by the thing.”3
                            In J. S. Mill’s view, “the one fact which the Psychological theory can-
                    not explain, is the fact of Memory” because it was something of a
                    chicken/egg problem for a field of study that assumed the continuity
                    of ego from the outset.4 This conundrum may well help explain why,
                    as Nicholas Dames has suggested, memory went underground in
                    mid-Victorian psychology.5 Samuel Butler infamously revived the issue
                    in his Life and Habit (1877), where he literalized the problem by arguing
                    that causality was the wrong way of understanding the relation of the
                    chicken to the egg: both were merely a “part-phase” of a transgenera-
                    tional “unconscious memory.” Here the thing is the thing: ego is self-
                    identical with memory because the individual is merely the “continuation
                    of the personality of every ovum in the chain of its ancestry.”6 As he later
                    summarized the drift of this argument, memory should be understood as
                    a process not of mental association but of organic “assimilation . . . the
                    imbuing one thing with the memories of another.”7
                            In one view, then, a self is formed through the possession and cultiva-
                    tion of memories; in the other, selves are byproducts. Henry Maudsley tried
                    to parse this difference as the distinction between bodily memory—organic
                    effects—and mental recollection—the organization of effects into “func-
                    tional activity.” But association is trumped by assimilation in the contest
                    between mind and body, for “in every nerve-cell there is memory [. . .]
                    We may forget it, but it will not forget us.” Indeed, so strong are these mem-
                    ory “inscriptions” that individual volition cannot “efface their characters.”
                    Mental life should thus be understood as a kind of defensive maneuver
                    against memory, as with any slight disruption of consciousness a memory
                    may “thus some time be accidentally revealed.”8
                            That is precisely the experience of the eponymous narrator in May
                    Sinclair’s novelistic reflection on Victorian memory, Mary Olivier: A Life
                    (1919). You cannot recollect a past that never forgets you, Mary

              concludes by reference to Maudsley, for in this version of memory there
              is no you: “There were no independent, separate entities, no sacred, invi-
              olable selves. They were one immense organism and you were part of it;
              you were nothing that they had not been before you.” Emphasizing this
              interconnectedness, the narrator refers to herself variously in the second
              and third person, with first person taking over briefly in the novel’s final
              line: “If it never came again I should remember.”9 The complexity of this
              sentence summarizes the Victorian uncertainty about the status of mem-
              ory. Is this statement a warning about a past that won’t lose its hold? A
              hope that memory will cease and allow one to recollect one’s self? An
              imperative to make the leap of faith required to posit, however briefly,
              an I who remembers?
                      Such uncertainty seems still very much with us, in the revived
              debates about our relation to the Victorians. Can we break free of
              the “transtemporal persistence of literary and cultural forms” so that
              “past cultural formations or structures of feeling” resonate with the pre-
              sent “without coming directly into contact”?10 Or is this distance a delu-
              sion? Are we “habitually, perhaps inevitably, presentist” in our reading
              of the past,11 not so much because we approach it from the perspective
              of the twenty-first century, but because Victorian “inscriptions” still set
              the terms? Is a hermeneutics of suspicion a defensive maneuver against
              the accidental revelation that we are nothing that they had not been
              before us? Even methods of distant reading, which seem to get around
              such impasses, look remarkably close to a Victorian view of organic
              memory as “being nothing but the revived stimulation of the brain
              cells where neural paths having once met, meet forever” in the manner
              of “an immense fantastic telephone exchange.” Memory here is the
              product of “the automatic stamping out of weaker and less frequent
              associations by stronger and more frequent ones.” The result is an
              unvarying reproductive loop, a process of “automatic association”
              whereby “we remember, never because we choose, but always because
              we must.”12
                      Perhaps we should ask not how to remember the Victorians, but
              whether they will forget us. Is there an act of reading that is not always
              assimilation, in the Butlerian sense of that term? Does it take a leap of
              faith to conjure the twenty-first century reader in the presence of a
              Victorian text? We might conclude, with John Stuart Mill, that correspon-
              dences and associations are a trick of the mind, and that to distill our-
              selves from our memories of the Victorians is merely an instance of
              explaining the thing by the thing.

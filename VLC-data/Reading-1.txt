                    of engaging with the physical world. In this regard, nineteenth-century
                    novels are not so much a training ground where readers practice forms
                    of perception that they will apply in everyday life. Rather, the knowledge
                    they have acquired and the capacities they have honed from the cumula-
                    tive labor of everyday experience make it possible for readers to grasp a
                    scene that is totally absent from the senses.

                    B       Y the end of the nineteenth century, few social questions had not
                             been linked to what, in 1845, Sarah Stickney Ellis called “the art
                    of reading well.”1 Little wonder, then, that many of today’s most imagina-
                    tive theories of this art have emerged among scholars of nineteenth-
                    century literature; taking this object of study, theorists of methods such
                    as surface reading, distant reading, and curatorial reading reproduce a
                    major concern of their era of study. But unlike those of their

                                                                                                              READING               827
              antecedents, these theories are chiefly academic: how we read as a
              dimension of how we research. Rare is the theory inherited from the
              Victorians themselves, whose beliefs about reading are largely relegated
              to the purportedly uncritical prehistory of academic professionalization.
              But understanding what constitutes critical reading requires ascertaining
              what it has been—necessitates asking, in Michael Warner’s words, “what
              alternative reading disciplines might be misrecognized as uncritical.”2 As
              Jonathan Kramnick and Anahid Nersessian have recently suggested,
              methodological pluralism is a sign of the health of a discipline.3 In
              that spirit, the conceptual resources of earlier eras might form a larger
              share of contemporary conversations about reading. In particular, exca-
              vating a lapsed culture of reading built around the social value of the
              endeavor stands not only to enrich contemporary research methods,
              but to help forge neglected links between specialized disciplinary tools
              and strategies for broader public engagement.
                      Even as major monographs of the past few decades have revealed the
              heterogeneity of nineteenth-century approaches to reading, the full his-
              tory is still richer, stranger, and more diverse than we have yet under-
              stood.4 Throughout the era, reading strategies promoted to mass
              audiences offered both rigor and system, even as practitioners formu-
              lated broad ideals that left room for adaptation to textual specificity.
              For figures such as Blanche Leppington and Geraldine Jewsbury, for
              instance, it was crucial to read novels like Ivanhoe or The Moonstone
              twice to appreciate, distinctly, both plot and form: first, as Leppington
              put it, “for the sake of the story itself, and then for the sake of observing
              how it has been constructed.”5 In 1889, the National Home Reading
              Union formed to promote the “organisation of reading, its method
              and system”6 by convening local reading groups, pressing members “to
              form opinions for themselves,”7 and publishing monthly journals that
              posed interpretive “questions and difficulties.” These efforts consolidated
              more and less formal protocols—“rules for reading”8—that had emerged
              over decades in popular journals, elocution guides, literary reviews, and
              public lectures. Yet reading credos also often consciously avoided formal-
              izing particular prescriptions, and instead praised the spontaneity and
              unpredictability of a lively, context-responsive form of reading so unlike
              the kind inculcated in what Frederic Harrison deemed the “patent high-
              pressure Reading Machine” of modern education.9 Indeed, the era’s
              popular reading advocates consistently suggest that theories and methods
              cannot be fully determined in advance; rather, texts indicate their own
              modes of analysis and interpretation. Theorists today might productively

                    appropriate this stance of openness from their predecessors, whose
                    model of reading often stresses what Rachel Ablow has described as “a
                    willingness to accommodate ambivalence, ambiguity, and perhaps most
                    important, surprise.”10
                            The names that constellate this lost history are largely unfamiliar, yet
                    their questions remain vital. How is it, asked Richard Chevenix Trench—
                    pondering the concept of subtext through Ralph Waldo Emerson’s idea
                    of language as “fossil poetry”—that texts both say what they say and say
                    what they don’t say?11 Can fiction offer readers, as Anne Mozley believed
                    it could, a distinct way of knowing?12 How might reflective reading prac-
                    tices be rendered habitual, Lucy Soulsby wondered, without becoming
                    rote?13 In order to become better “interpreters of human things” writ
                    large, as James Welldon put it, should we work to reconcile disparate ele-
                    ments of a text rather than enjoying it “cut up or boiled down”—a prac-
                    tice, then as now, extoled widely and employed rarely?14 What, more
                    generally, was entailed by the widespread charge to “read with attention,”
                    and how did it relate to Arthur Helps’s advice to “read with method,”15
                    Sydney Smith’s injunctions to “read heartily,”16 or prevailing conceptions
                    of the importance of “close thinking”?17 These questions were reprised
                    throughout the century, commonly in settings designed to foster debate.
                    Far from a solitary enterprise, reading was meant to be discussed among
                    members of a community: “If it was not worth conversing about,” John
                    Cassell insisted, “it was not worth reading.”18 This collective ideal of read-
                    ing prompted the Home Reading Union’s formation of collaborative
                    reading societies designed to facilitate discussion of the “diverse opinions
                    of different writers” through the “comparing influence of thought.”19
                    The Union’s model drew upon that of the American Chautauqua
                    societies—wherein, Joshua Girling Fitch enthused, “collective reading
                    and mutual conference” worked to “quicken into new enthusiasm” the
                    literary aspirations of participants20—and rapidly enfolded older organi-
                    zations like the Glasgow Eclectic Reading Club, who had first banded in
                    order to “give more definition to our reading.”21 Among political actors
                    of many stripes, reading skills were framed as tools for parsing ideological
                    glosses, holding legislators accountable, and devising canny appeals for
                    liberation. The belief was not without warrant: as Leah Price has
                    shown, anxieties and fantasies about the spread of literacy underwrote
                    many of the era’s defining siociopolitical reforms.22
                            Exploring outmoded beliefs about reading is not an act of
                    navel-gazing, but a means of recovering lost skills and cultivating contem-
                    porary strategies. Earlier reading practices are already resurfacing in the

              readings in the serial installments in which they originally circulated,
              or to rethink memorization and recitation—nineteenth-century
              stock-in-trade—not as a flattening of the analytic enterprise, but, with
              the right framing, as an embodied enhancement to it.23 Other
              approaches from the era stand to set current doxa of literary-critical
              scholarship in productive tension. Reading with the nineteenth century,
              when thinkers found lively ways to speculate about authorial meaning
              without regarding it as definitive—when, indeed, annotation was often
              framed as a form of colloquy with authorial opinions readers were
              licensed to dissent from—we might ask why intention is still so frequently
              invoked as a fallacy. We might also reconceive lingering taboos against
              identification, absorption, and other messy affective states by drawing
              inspiration from Victorian attempts to reconcile informational and imag-
              inative reading.24 In so doing, we might devise a more nuanced vocabu-
              lary for the structures of feeling that attend experiences of reading.
              Perhaps most simply, we might articulate anew the value of rereading
              and emphasize the surprising way in which—as many a bygone theorist
              has marveled—the literary object becomes stranger with each reentrance
              into its pages. Nineteenth-century thinkers had creative ideas about these
              and other facets of the reading process, resources to draw upon in elab-
              orating practices that are less starkly divided between professional and
              ordinary readers. In unearthing these older methods, we need not
              replace abiding ones, but might find good cause to rethink them.

              I   N considering Aru, the young, idealistic protagonist of her 1996 novel
                   A Matter of Time, Indian novelist Shashi Deshpande has her narrator
              muse on her own narratorial/authorial enterprise and technique:
                      But to [admit knowledge of the future into her narrative] is to admit that
                      Aru is the heroine of this story; only for the heroine can Time be bent back-
                      wards.
                             Is Aru the heroine? Why not? She has youth, one of the necessary
                      requirements of a heroine. And the other—beauty? Well, possibly. The
                      potential is there anyway. (The Natyashastra lays down that the heroine
                      should have nobility and steadfastness as well. But we can ignore this. We
                      no longer make such demands on our heroines.) Perhaps there’s this too,
                      this above all, that Aru is trying to make sense of what is happening.1
                      Victorianists might easily recognize the allusion to George Eliot’s
              famous “why always Dorothea?” passage from Middlemarch, making
              explicit not only the connection between the two protagonists but also
              the genres in which they appear. We might then ask: if the allusion to

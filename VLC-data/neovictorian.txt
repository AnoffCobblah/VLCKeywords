                    Neo-Victorian
                    MOLLY CLARK HILLARD
                    A       T its inception in the early twentieth century, the term
                             “neo-Victorian” was a noun—a person whose “values, attitudes, or
                    behavior hark back to” the Victorian era. Two decades later, it had
                    also become an adjective, meaning “resembling, reviving, or reminiscent
                    of” the Victorian period.1 By the late twentieth century, it came to
                    describe postmodern works (primarily novels, such as John Fowles’s
                    The French Lieutenant’s Woman2 or A.S. Byatt’s Possession3) set in the
                    Victorian or Edwardian periods. And recently, twenty-first century critical
                    study has broadened the definition of neo-Victorian: now virtually any lit-
                    erary, filmic, or cultural text may signal our contemporary investment in
                    Victorian modes, ideologies, and problems. Monographs like Jay
                    Clayton’s Charles Dickens in Cyberspace,4 critical compendia like John
                    Kucich and Dianne Sadoff’s Victorian Afterlife,5 and the founding of the
                    Journal of Neo-Victorian Studies in 2008 exemplify neo-Victorianism’s
                    entrenchment in the post-9/11 critical landscape.
                            When I first began writing on the intersections of Victorian and con-
                    temporary literatures, I, too, identified my studies as neo-Victorian, in
                    part because it seemed to be the only way to describe contemporary
                    texts that cede time and space to Victorian ideologies.6 But in recent
                    years, I have struggled with the phrase. I have come to believe that, rather
                    than “hark(ing) back” or “reviving” Victorian literature, certain twenty-
                    first century works problematize the very notion of temporal borders.
                    Such texts are not neo-Victorian, but in some sense still Victorian. My
                    change in thinking has been inspired in part by the founding of the
                    V21 Collective, and in part by those scholars who see strict periodicity
                    as a form of nationalism. Rita Felski, for instance, has challenged the par-
                    adigm of historical periods that “consists of a vertical pile of neatly stacked
                    boxes . . . each of which surrounds, sustains, and subsumes a microcul-
                    ture.”7 In this view, says Felski, “historicism serves as the functional equiv-
                    alent of cultural relativism.”8 What Felski suggests instead is aligned with
                    Bruno Latour’s actor-network theory,9 or what she calls “the transtemporal
                    movement and affective resonance of particular texts.”10 More specifically
                    reflecting on Victorian literature, Kate Flint sees periodization not as static
                    knowledge formation, but rather as “a malleable instrument at our dis-
                    posal,” and argues that “the importance of [the Victorian] period lies in
                    the extent to which it is still contiguous . . . with the formation of our

                                                                                                 NEO -V I CTORI AN                  781
              own world and in the development . . . of a number of different moderni-
              ties.”11 Such critics are concerned with the state of the field (literary stud-
              ies broadly and Victorian studies specifically). I, too, am interested in what
              light may be shed upon how and why we read and re-read Victorian liter-
              ature: what it may offer to us in the way of resistance, and how it directs us
              to a variety of institutional spaces that we in the twenty-first century still
              inhabit, for better and for worse.
                      Such works that are still, rather than newly, Victorian, might embed
              specific Victorian literary texts directly into their frameworks (like Ian
              McEwan’s Saturday).12 They might affiliate with Victorian modes, narra-
              tive styles, plots, and characters (like Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me
              Go).13 They may be saturated more generally in Victorian literary and cul-
              tural history (like Zadie Smith’s White Teeth).14 In all cases, novels like
              these take on explicitly Victorian questions of community, authority, self-
              possession, and the nature and purpose of artistic production. And in all
              cases, such works perceive Victorian literature to be networked to them,
              creating a community that exists in time rather than space. Such a com-
              munity is often uneasy rather than homogeneous or harmonious, but is
              nonetheless vitally important to constituting personhood, to building any
              kind of human belonging that matters. These contemporary works, then,
              demand that we reconceive of both globality and temporality. They sug-
              gest that literature produces its own diaspora, one networked with other
              scatterings—ethnic, religious, and economic. As Rebecca Walkowitz has
              said, “translation and global circulation create many books out of single
              texts, transforming old traditions and inaugurating new ones.”15 Wai
              Chee Dimock has called this way of seeing “diachronic historicism,”
              where “the text [is] a temporal continuum, thick with receding and
              incipient nuances.”16 In novels that vex periodicity through temporal
              simultaneity, their authors imply that global literature is diachronic as
              well as synchronic. In this way, we might begin to see Victorian literature
              as a contribution to world literature.
                      Tellingly, the works that inspired contemporary novels like the ones
              above are themselves about literary inspiration. Frankenstein, Jane Eyre,
              Villette, Wuthering Heights, “Dover Beach,” Mill on the Floss, and Daniel
              Deronda are all Victorian texts that offer crucial scenes of reading and
              re-reading. These are all works in which acts of reading begin or escalate
              the action, in which books—history books, science books, devotional
              books—are central to the text’s aims. These novels in particular feature
              characters whose acts of reading may make or mar them, but in one way
              or another seal their fates. These characters insert themselves into a

                    literary history—not just resonating with it or speaking back to it, but
                    actually taking the book as literal or real. Frankenstein’s creature reads
                    Paradise Lost as “a true history”;17 Jane Eyre sees Gulliver’s Travels as “a nar-
                    rative of facts”;18 Maggie Tulliver and Mr. Lockwood are in thrall to
                    found texts with handwritten marginalia that directs or arrests their atten-
                    tion.19 I would argue that these are literary subjects; by calling attention to
                    the books in their hands they remind us of the books in ours, and their
                    fabrication, their materiality. Simultaneously, though, they suggest that
                    we are bound to, subject to, subjects of, the books we read.
                            We should be alive to those contemporary works with scenes and
                    characters that demand, like their Victorian counterparts, to be read as
                    literary subjects. We are used, perhaps, to define literary subjectivity as
                    does Simon During: “a love of literature, more or less disjunct from
                    explicit identification with political programmes” and the production
                    of “fictions and simulacra and the provision of spaces and occasions
                    for individuals to be communicated to” in a kind of “secular mimesis.”20
                    And if we do define it in this way, we are apt to associate literary subjec-
                    tivity with, at best, an embarrassing lack of critical distance, and, at worst,
                    a dangerous political and social myopia. But what if we were to take liter-
                    ary subjectivity more literally—and seriously? What if we were to dilate
                    more precisely on “subjectivity,” taking it not merely in the sense of
                    “perceptible only to the individual,” “absorbed in one’s personal feel-
                    ings,” etc. that we have tended to mean by this term, but also in the phil-
                    osophical or metaphysical sense of “conscious being” and “relating to the
                    thinking mind,” and in the geopolitical sense of being “under the influ-
                    ence of” or pledging “obedience or allegiance to” that it also means?21 In
                    this sense, literary subjectivity could mean that we are part book in ways
                    that are pleasurable as well as painful. I propose that we consider those
                    works that pledge allegiance to Victorian paratexts less neo-Victorian than
                    a networked relationship of, in the words of Leah Price, “reading . . . han-
                    dling . . . and circulating . . . the book,”22 a relationship that leads us
                    constantly back to Victorian texts and narrative strategies.

                                                                                                —Henry James, In the Cage1
                    H         ENRY James begins his 1898 novella In the Cage with an anonymous
                               young woman who works in a London post office as a telegrapher.
                    Victorianists have been drawn to the story for its fascinating lessons about
                    telegraphic knowledge, gendered labor, surveillance, and the media
                    ecology of the fin de siècle. Yet the story also offers a prescient glimpse
                    of contemporary problems in humanities research: how to manage,
                    read, and interpret texts at scale. The telegrapher’s actual postal scale
                    is just part of her quantitative labor: she deals in the quanta and counting
                    of stamps, change, questions, and words. She also experiences texts in
                    excess of measure: words “numberless as the sands of the sea.” In the
                    Cage not only thematizes the vast scale of textual proliferation which char-
                    acterized the nineteenth century, it dramatizes the telegrapher’s search
                    for meaning in the masses of words beyond counting. In the Cage is an
                    early story of “distant reading,” a reckoning with how scale might require
                    an unfamiliar form of hermeneutics. For Victorian studies, the problems
                    of innumerable things and how to interpret them manifest doubly as a
                    historical phenomenon and a contemporary methodological challenge.
                            Victorian commentators perceived such a shift in the extraordinary
                    expansion of printed materials which attended industrial printing pro-
                    cesses, demographic changes in readership, efficient distribution net-
                    works, and increasing literacy, among other factors. Perhaps every
                    historical period claims to be overwhelmed with its own information,
                    but in the nineteenth century, as Elizabeth Miller argues, the “nearly
                    incalculable volume of new print material made for a qualitative, not
                    just quantitative, shift in the identity of print as a medium.”2 Victorian
                    commentators newly characterized the printed landscape as a mass phe-
                    nomenon, amounting to what Linda K. Hughes calls “the first mass-
                    media era.”3 Proliferation and politics mingle in these notions of the
                    masses and how and whether they could be counted, or at what scales
                    perceived. Benjamin Morgan suggests that scale structures perception

              and clears conceptual space for other cultural projects.4 With respect to
              print, Miller argues that the efforts to convert “a massive, sublimely
              ungraspable print culture into something more human-scaled” produce
              other forms of knowledge work, including new genres of literary writing
              and criticism.5
                      Scale challenged not simply the mechanics but the interpretive coher-
              ence of reading, the sense of how a textual medium even worked. Miller
              points to the Victorian book review as a signature response. In considering
              global and planetary scales, Morgan argues that decadent writers under-
              took “acts of imagination that situate the totality of human life in relation
              to the totality of natural systems,” all “in order to contemplate their shared
              fate” and thus theorize about the anthropocene.6 Anna Henchman identi-
              fies the novel as among several “large-scale systems” which variously tried to
              measure sprawling complexity.7 Victorian astronomy, Henchman argues,
              provided novelists a model for managing perspectives at various scales.
              To these arguments, I would add the nascent interest in literary stylistics
              as something to count, measure, and interpret—perhaps first articulated
              in an 1887 article in Science magazine which charts comparative word
              lengths in Charles Dickens’s Oliver Twist, William Makepeace Thackeray’s
              Vanity Fair, and John Stuart Mill’s essays on political economy.8
                      “Distant reading” is not solely the purview of computers, but of count-
              ing. Ted Underwood traces its genealogy to mid-twentieth century experi-
              ments in quantitative methods, but Victorian examples suggest an earlier
              engagement with its methods and the interpretive problematics at its
              core.9 In their pamphlet A Quantitative Literary History of 2,958
              Nineteenth-Century British Novels written for the Stanford Literary Lab,
              Ryan Heuser and Le-Khac Long put it this way: “The general methodolog-
              ical problem of the digital humanities can be bluntly stated: How do we get
              from numbers to meaning?”10 This question has roots in the questions
              many Victorian writers were asking about how to swim in oceans of textual
              information in multiply mediated forms.11 In his subsequent preface to In
              the Cage, James describes his own interest in the telegraph office for its
              cacophony, having “so much of London to give out, so much of its huge per-
              petual story to tell.” As James explains, “So had grown up, for speculation . . .
              the question of what it might ‘mean.’”12 In the Cage is among several
              Victorian examples which explore “the question of what it might ‘mean’”
              in terms of counting words, quantitative inference, and literary criticism.13
                      The digital has reinvigorated our engagement with Victorian scale.
              Natalie Houston describes the “large-scale digitization of nineteenth-century
              books and periodicals” as producing “evidence at new scale,” including

                    historical texts as well as their computational features.14 Importantly,
                    Houston stresses that scale happens at various sizes, challenging the fallacy
                    of “big data” with an emphasis on carefully curated data sets and interpretive
                    dexterity. Digital methods must be scalable, too. For instance, Ryan Cordell
                    coins the term “‘zoomable reading, in which one moves between levels of
                    perspective.”15 Michael Witmore goes even further, arguing that approach-
                    ing texts at variable scales has always been an interpretive possibility: the
                    seeming novelty of large-scale digitized materials just reminds us of the “mas-
                    sive addresseability” of text.16 As the Victorians apprehended an enormous
                    increase in printed materials, they too struggled with the problems of scale,
                    the question of what it might mean, and the critical opportunities of trying to
                    find out in new ways.

              T      HE most interesting of recent developments in Victorian literary
                     scholarship has been our obsession not with the Victorians but
              with ourselves. We have become fascinated by invoking the Victorians
              in order to consider our contemporary conditions. This self-
              interrogation has been both welcomed and contested. For literature
              and science scholars it has been puzzling, for Victorian literature and sci-
              ence has a long tradition of scholarly critique that takes account of both
              past and present. It has also been satisfying, since the turn towards our
              own historical moment has seen the study of literature and science
              take up a place at the very heart of Victorian literature and culture.
              This interest in our present moment and its attachments to Victorian cul-
              tures is important because it is making us think creatively about the
              future praxis of Victorian scholarship. It is enabling us to consider new
              ways of conceiving of the temporal gap between the Victorians and our-
              selves and what knowledge crossing that gap might generate.
                      This temporal turn is clear in the significant proportion of recent
              Victorian research that has focussed, for example, on ecological
              crises: from environmental violence and studies of the anthropocene

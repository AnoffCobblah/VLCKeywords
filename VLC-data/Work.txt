                    Work
                    JOSHUA GOOCH
                    I    F any word is central to the Victorian frame of mind, it is work. After
                          all, Carlyle’s gospel of work, what Walter Houghton rightly frames
                    more broadly as the Victorian “religion of work,” permeates the era.1 If
                    Victorianists have come to think differently about work in the twenty-first
                    century, this shift reflects changes in the social, political, and economic
                    positions of Victorianists as such. Scholarship in late capitalism exists
                    within a world that has denatured work’s Carlylean delineation as useful
                    and masculine physical and intellectual activity and revealed it to include
                    manifold ways of doing gendered, managerial, clerical, domestic, and,
                    perhaps above all, emotional labor. Victorianists are likely to feel closer
                    to the digging navvies, the dingy plantseller, and the female pamphleteer
                    in Ford Madox Brown’s painting than to the idly posed Carlyle and
                    Maurice, able to watch and theorize work at a safe remove.2
                            The naked political economic turn of the twenty-first century forces
                    Victorianists to confront in new and stark forms the ways in which work
                    enacts power relations, how disparate discourses and practices articulate
                    the demand to work, and the ways in which workers are not merely
                    shaped by this demand but may, through their resistances, reshape the
                    particularities of those demands. Such an alteration brings to the fore
                    the ways in which contemporary political economic conditions echo
                    Victorian asymmetries.3 The postindustrial turn of the late twentieth cen-
                    tury witnessed the collapse of manufacturing jobs, the rise of finance,
                    and the proletarianization of professional work, shifts that resonate
                    with the nineteenth-century rise of the invisible industries, expansion
                    of the service sector around the urban core, and expansion of clerical
                    labor in the century’s final decades.4 The so-called feminization of
                    labor in the twenty-first century echoes the same kind of fears that ani-
                    mated reactions to the New Woman and fears of instrumentalized social
                    relations.5 One needn’t press far into economic histories to infer the ways
                    in which technological disruptions similarly connect the past and pre-
                    sent. The constant threat of machine automation that nineteenth-
                    century workers confronted now confronts all forms of work, including
                    service workers, intellectual work, and even artistic production, and raises
                    fundamental existential questions about our social, political, and eco-
                    nomic structures.6 To confront these resonances of economic precarity
                    in the present is to reevaluate their effects in the past, to feel the ways

              in which economic insecurity shot through even the so-called age of
              equipoise.
                      Yet for transhistorical research, the crucial differences that questions
              of work raise are as much political as economic, from the weak responses
              of reform-minded liberals across the nineteenth and twenty-first centuries
              to the radically different histories of the successes and failures of labor
              organizing, mass action, and responses to imperial war. Questions about
              work’s organizational forms, then, become increasingly important as
              they uncover how coalitions may come into being (or not), and how
              they may operate (or fail to do so). Research about the role of work can
              uncover cultural and social fracture lines through which pressures may
              operate within and upon the work-relation, or within and upon relations
              implicated in but outside the wage, most especially reproductive work
              and the position of dependents. To rethink work for the Victorian era is
              thus to rethink the ways in which race and gender articulate class relations,
              and to bring forward both reactionary responses as well as the persistent
              but varied resistances made to the demand to work.7

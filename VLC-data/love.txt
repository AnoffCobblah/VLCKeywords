                    W          HAT did they talk about, those eminent Victorians, when they
                               talked about love? For people whose stiff collars, corsets, and cus-
                    toms seemed designed to evade intimacy, they nevertheless bumped
                    into love in every form: romantic love; erotic fixation; affection (some-
                    times chilling) to children and devotion to husbands and wives; and
                    not the least, love of dogs. God was love; the love of nature led to love
                    of mankind; In Memoriam ends with a wedding; and even passionless
                    John Stuart Mill, the thinking machine, wrote a dedication of
                    such intense feeling that it embarrassed his friends. It was love that was
                    real; love that was earnest; and the grave was not its end—for, “if God
                    choose, / I shall but love thee better after death.”1
                            At our current moment, we, too, seem a little embarrassed by
                    Victorian love. A strangely Utilitarian account of love is resurgent in
                    our literary criticism, offering an unexpected echo of an earlier era.
                    Our view of the Victorians was once that of Walter Houghton’s
                    Victorian Frame of Mind: married love was a sacrament; lust something
                    that existed outside of marriage, in both senses—there might be fierce

                                                                                                                      LOV E         753
              erotic entanglements (casual or not) outside those sacred bonds, but the
              nature of marriage was to exclude the animalistic as fiercely as the hearth
              banished the harshness of the marketplace. Houghton had this in mind
              when he wrote of love that it was “passion that was very much tempered
              by reverence and confined to the home . . . and [whose] object was
              scarcely mortal.”2 “Otherwise,” he continued with certitude, “love was
              not love but lust.” True love was familial, and it pointed us, as
              Alexander Welsh argued, to the “heavenly city” beyond the dusty
              Victorian streets. “To address a Victorian heroine as ‘sister’ is merely
              the prelude to a warmer theme,”3 as Welsh put it in discussing David
              Copperfield: “the point of transmuting sweethearts and wives into sisters
              and daughters, or of living snugly with sisters and daughters as well as
              wives, was not necessarily to substitute one for the other female relation,
              but ideally to enjoy both, or all three relations in the enclosure of the
              hearth.”4
                      Lust of course has not stayed quite so nicely quarantined as that. Leo
              Bersani noted the ferocity of romantic love within the marriage plot;5
              Michel Foucault and D. A. Miller questioned the disciplinary force
              exerted when David Copperfield learned to recognize “the first mistaken
              impulses of an undisciplined heart”;6 feminists have continued to speak
              with the passion of Jane Eyre, “Do you think, because I am poor, obscure,
              plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong!”7 “Erotic
              faith,” to borrow from Robert Polhemus, has certainly had its bodice-ripping
              moment in the sun.8
                      Yet now the “familiar marriage” has returned with a vengeance, and
              with it, romance seems to have slunk out of the room. Talia Schaffer’s
              recent Romance’s Rival has more than one good word to say for the mar-
              riage of service which Jane Eyre rejected and the devotion which
              Houghton enshrined. It defends, with considerable wit and depth, the
              religious mission which St. John Rivers offers Jane, and it wonders why
              romantic love seems so desperately urgent. For Schaffer, St. John’s pro-
              posal is not just a sop to convention (they cannot travel together if
              unmarried) but a vision of a life of Christian usefulness, a proposal
              fiercely scorned by the passionate heroine, but nonetheless, as
              Schaeffer nicely points out, strangely mimicked in the way Jane’s eventual
              marriage to Rochester takes on many of the same notions of care, service
              and even (gasp!) “nursing.”
                      But it takes more than one blinded husband to take the sexuality
              out of Jane Eyre: indeed, romantic love is not so easy to displace from
              the center of any sites of Victorian literature and culture. If Welsh

                    imagines marriage as a heavenly city, he also reminds us that “enjoying
                    all three relations in the enclosure of the hearth” has its own kinkier
                    side, “combin[ing] those roles in a single sentence . . . incant[ing]
                    ‘This dear face, revered as a father’s, loved as a husband’s, sacred to
                    me in my childhood as a friend’s.’”9 And staying only with Copperfield
                    for the moment, when Welsh reminds us “who, in the language of
                    detective fiction, was the last person to see Dora Copperfield alive,”10
                    we must also remember that when David finally proposes to Agnes
                    Wickfield, she (who sat by his first wife’s deathbed) confesses that “I
                    have loved you all my life.”11 At this moment the novel reveals a
                    dark, fierce, even adulterous passion at its heart, one that looks less
                    like incest than cannibalism, feeding on the corpses of others, desper-
                    ate for what it craves. In that view of romantic passion, to borrow from a
                    very late Victorian, Kate Atkinson: “She should have said, ‘I have no
                    idea how to love another human being unless it’s by tearing them to
                    pieces and eating them.’”12
                            For there remains a savagery at the heart of even the most domesti-
                    cated love in the Victorian novel. Miss Havisham reminds Pip to “give up
                    your whole heart and soul to the smiter” and Estella that “you can break
                    his heart”;13 Catherine Earnshaw loves Edgar Linton because he is
                    handsome, kind, and rich, “like the foliage,” but her love for
                    Heathcliff “resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible
                    delight—but necessary”;14 even Sam Weller, when he is inspired to write
                    a valentine for his Mary, finds “a highly coloured representation of a cou-
                    ple of human hearts skewered together with an arrow, cooking before a
                    cheerful fire, while a male and female cannibal in modern attire: the
                    gentleman being clad in a blue coat and white trousers, and the lady
                    in a deep red pelisse with a parasol of the same: were approaching the
                    meal with hungry eyes.”15 To love and to eat were not so different
                    after all: by the time of Far From the Madding Crowd, the valentine
                    Bathsheba Everdene sends to Farmer Boldwood (“marry me!”) is female
                    high-spiritedness, nasty plot snare, and a good man’s psychological
                    undoing—and it constitutes a literally murderous debt drawn out of
                    the heroine for much of the novel, until finally her name and her
                    voice disappear. The word “wife” appears four times in the final two
                    pages of the text, and Bathsheba is silenced (consumed) entirely.
                    Cannibalism proves as hard to disavow as sweethearts to “transmute”—
                    the enclosure of the hearth can’t keep out fiercer fires. Or rather, the
                    tamest of domestic fires may blaze forth unexpectedly.

                      So although we imagine the marriage plot as a sorting device, it is
              not so easy to know what is love and what is service. When the heroine
              makes her initial, intricate, fatal choice, we might be taking pleasure in
              the compare-and-contrast suitors, but not only is it difficult to decide
              which is familiar and which dangerous (is it Henleigh Grandcourt or
              Daniel Deronda who is the stranger?), but the alchemy of the marriage
              plot is a preparation for an even darker alchemy to come, one in
              which, under coverture, a wife disappears into her husband’s legal iden-
              tity. The heroine is both a choosing subject and a piece of property, and
              the contracting does not end with that first promise, of love, honor, and
              obedience. If, as Nancy Miller noted, where men get plots of ambition,
              for women their “ambitious wishes” must be filtered through plots of
              “erotic longing,”16 and, as Schaffer demonstrates, women seek not love
              but “socially rich lives and futures of meaningful work,”17 it is not clear
              how to get one without the other. How does one bear a life of daily com-
              promises without romantic faith; how can you live a life of empty adora-
              tion without something to yearn for beyond the self? The marriage plot is
              not just a sorting device, it is a balancing act.
                      Love remains a (passionate) site of negotiation, because marriage is
              not a tableau of people fixed motionless around a fire but a constant
              whirling thing. If the Victorians seem torn between prudishness and pru-
              rience; between repression and explosion; between the cozy warmth of
              the hearth and the erotics of the street, lost lovers forever wailing on
              some wuthering heath, it is because the ghosts are not so much angry
              as confused, contorted, contracted, trying to do too much, to say too
              much, when they say “I love.” As Welsh hints, and as we risk forgetting,
              the Victorians were incapable of imagining love as anything but a tangle.
              But though the Victorians invented Wemmick in his castle, imagining he
              could keep law and prisons and fardels outside, they also invented love as
              a way of opening the doors of the home to something larger than the
              lonely self. Elizabeth Barrett Browning, famous enumerator of things
              out of reach, offers an answer, again quoted by Kate Atkinson in When
              Will There Be Good News. In writing of love at the end of life, Barrett
              Browning knew “that when light is gone / Love remains for shining.”18
              She wrote those lines for her dog, Flush, and if Virginia Woolf objected
              to Charlotte Bronte’s heroines always saying, “‘I love’, ‘I hate,’”19 she
              probably had fewer objections to Flush, about whom she herself wrote
              a book. What is it that love sees? Something, Welsh is right, that lies
              beyond the streets, but not necessarily only in the heavens: it lies in
              the flashing, curious, unknowable eyes of another.
